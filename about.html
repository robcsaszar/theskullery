    Over the years, I've tried dozens of recipe apps and services in an attempt to cook better and get more organized.<br>
    As expected, not all recipes will be original ones, since I have had most of these written down or bookmarked somewhere. Most of them will have a credit <em>(edit: As of the 6th of July not all recipes have a credit URL <strong>yet</strong>, I am actively working on that.)</em> to your website, however if you'd like me to remove one of your own recipes from the website, please contact me at <a class="squigglyURL--main" href="mailto:recipes@theskullery.net">recipes@theskullery.net</a> and it'll be taken down immediately.<br>
    This website is my attempt at getting my recipes organized and categorized by moving them from closed services and random handwritten pages to a more open, beautiful, and shareable place while having the convenience to customize everything to a "recipe-first" approach. Furthermore, since almost 90% of us browse via mobile, I wanted us to have a better mobile experience.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="sitename"><em>the<strong>Skullery</strong></em>.net</span> is all about simplicity, and all recipes are integrated with <a class='squigglyURL--main' href="http://schema.org/Recipe">recipe microdata via schema.org</a>, which means websites like Google or Pinterest will know to differentiate the different ingredients, diets, and others between themselves. <br>
    <br>
    This is <strong>definitely</strong> a work in progress. This project helped me learn and consolidate my knowledge with a lot of languages and apps (Jekyll, Ruby, SCSS, JavaScript, Netlify, Cloudflare, Google Firebase). The website might go down from time to time, or break, the recipes are here to stay, though, and nothing will get lost.<br>
    If you have any questions or found some nasty bugs or any types of mistakes, please feel free to hit me up at <a aria-label="author" class="squigglyURL--main" href="mailto:robert@nhg.design">robert@nhg.design</a>.
