      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      Your privacy is important to us. It is Neue Haas Grotesk SRL's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a class="squigglyURL--main"
      href="https://theskullery.net"><span class="siteName--text"><span class="siteName">https://<em>the<strong>skullery</strong></em></span>.net</span></a>, and
    other sites we own and operate.<br>
      <h3>Information we collect</h3>
      <h4>Log data</h4>
      <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser.
        This data is considered “non-identifying information”, as it does not personally identify you on its own. It may
        include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the
        time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>
      <h4>Personal information</h4>
      <p>We may ask for personal information, such as your name and email address. This data is considered “identifying
        information”, as it can personally identify you. We only request personal information relevant to providing you
        with a service, and only use it to help provide or improve this service.</p>
      <h4>How we collect information</h4>
      <p>We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why
        we’re collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information, with the
        understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without it.</p>
      <h3>Use of information</h3>
      <p>We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to understand who our visitors are, how
        they use our services, and how we may improve their experience of our website in future. We do not disclose the
        specifics of this information publicly, but may share aggregated and anonymised versions of this information,
        for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.</p>
      <h3>Data processing and storage</h3>
      <p>We only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide a service, or to improve our services
        in future. While we retain this data, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss
        and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that
        no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>We use “cookies” to collect information about you and your activity across our site. A cookie is a small piece
        of data that our website stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit so we can understand how you
        use our site and serve you content based on preferences you have specified.</p>
      <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our
        website, understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without them.
        This policy covers only the use of cookies between your computer and our website; it does not cover the use of
        cookies by any third-party services we use on our site.</p>

      <p>We may use third-party services for our website and marketing activity. These services may access our data
        solely for the purpose of performing specific tasks on our behalf. We do not share any personally identifying
        information with these services without your explicit consent. We do not give these services permission to
        disclose or use any of our data for any other purpose.</p>
      <p>We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for data if we believe a request is too broad or
        unrelated to its stated purpose. However, we may cooperate if we believe the requested information is necessary
        and appropriate to comply with legal process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of
        the public and any person, to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe to be illegal, legally
        actionable, or unethical activity.</p>
      <p>We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We do not sell or rent your personal
        information to marketers or third parties.</p>

        details for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
      <h3>Limits of our policy</h3>

      <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a class="squigglyURL--main"
        href="https://theskullery.net"><span class="siteName--text"><span class="siteName"><em>the<strong>skullery</strong></em></span>.net</span></a>. This cookie policy is part of Neue Haas Grotesk
        SRL's privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your device and our site.</p>
      <p>If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from <a class="squigglyURL--main"
        href="https://theskullery.net"><span class="siteName--text"><span class="siteName"><em>the<strong>skullery</strong></em></span>.net</span></a>, with the understanding that we may be unable to
        provide you with some of your desired content and services.</p>
      <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing
        information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser
        when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
      </p>
      <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store
        your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising,
        language).</p>
      <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically
        only track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties)
        are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party
        service.</p>
      <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
      <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website.
        Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse
        cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>
