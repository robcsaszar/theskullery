servings: 1

ingredients:
- 3| tablespoons warm whole milk
- 128|g warm water
- 7|g instant yeast *good results with fresh yeast; 1:1 ratio* 
- 2.5 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1| large egg(s)
- 420|g all-purpose, 00-flour *allegedly better results with bread flour because of the higher protein count*
- 1.5| teaspoons fine salt
- 50|g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1| large egg(s) beaten with 1 tablespoon water *egg wash, for topping*
- sesame or poppy seeds *optional, for topping*

directions:
- Combine the milk, water, yeast, sugar, and egg. 
- If using active dry yeast, let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, until frothy, before continuing. 
- Add the flour to the bowl, and mix until incorporated. Mix in the salt and butter. Knead for about 10 minutes, or until the dough comes together into a soft yet tacky dough (should not be unbearably sticky). Avoid adding too much extra flour because it will create tough buns, itâ€™s better to be sticky than dense!
- Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours. *most times I leave it to proof overnight in the fridge*
- Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. Gently roll each portion of dough into a ball and place on baking sheet, at least 5cm apart. Cover with a clean towel and let rise again until puffy and almost doubled, aproximately 1.5 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. 
- Brush the tops of the buns lightly with the egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds. Bake the buns about 15 minutes, rotating halfway through baking, until the tops are golden brown. 
- Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Serve or store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to one month. Let defrost at room temperature before reheating in a 180Â°C oven until warmed or toasting.
