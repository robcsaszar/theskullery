time: under 60min # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsp olive oil
- 1| shallot diced
- 4| garlic cloves, minced
- 8| oz grape tomatoes
- 8| oz fresh mozzarella balls
- 4| campari tomatoes, thinly sliced
- 0.25| cup(s) pesto fresh, leftover or jarred
- 0.25| cup(s) fresh chopped basil
- 1| package whole wheat/brown rice lasagna noodles
- 1| cup(s) ricotta cheese
- 0.5| cup(s) freshly grated provolone cheese
- 0.5| cup(s) freshly grated mozzarella cheese
- 0.5| cup(s) freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
- fresh basil leaves for garnish

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 270°C.
- Heat a 10 or 12 inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the olive oil, then add in the shallots, garlic and and grape tomatoes with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until, the tomatoes begin to burst and break open, about 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the heat off under the skillet. You can mash up the tomatoes a bit if you’d like!
- While the tomatoes are cooking, bring a pot of salted water to a boil so you can cook the lasagna noodles. Cook them according to the package directions, but shave 1 minute off the cook time so the noodles are al dente. Drain the noodles once they are finished boiling.
- Take the noodles and begin to layer your lasagna. Put a few noodles down into the skillet, then add on some spoonfuls of ricotta cheese, pesto, some sliced tomatoes, some fresh mozzarella and some grated cheese. Add on a sprinkle of fresh basil. Arrange the noodles and repeat this process until all of your noodles and ingredients are used. Make sure you save a bit of grated cheese for topping.
- Bake the lasagna for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove it from the oven and garnish with extra fresh basil. Serve!
