ingredients:
- for the pulled pork:
- 4| pound pork shoulder, roasted
- 2| tsp tablespoon coarse salt
- 1| tsp pepper
- 1| tbsp canola or vegetable oil
- 0.3333| cup(s) your favorite beer
- 2| chipotles peppers diced
- 3| tbsp adobo sauce from the can of chipotles
- 3| tbsp peach preserves
- buns, for serving *brioche work best*
- for the pickled peaches:
- 0.75| cup(s) apple cider vinegar
- 0.75| cup(s) water
- 0.5| cup(s) sugar
- 2| tsp kosher salt
- 1| tsp crushed red pepper
- 1| tsp whole black peppercorns
- 3| peaches sliced
- for the quick slaw:
- 2| cup(s) chopped Napa cabbage
- 0.25| cup(s) chopped fresh cilantro
- 1| lime, juiced
- 1| tsp olive oil
- pinch of salt and pepper

directions:
- I find the flavor is best when the pork is seared first. My slow cooker sears the meat, but if yours does not, heat a large pot over medium to high heat and add the oil. Sprinkle the pork roast with the salt and pepper, then add it to the pot or slow cooker and sear on all sides until deeply golden brown. If necessary, transfer it to the slow cooker. Pour in the beer or liquid whichever you choose to use.
- Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours. After 8 to 10 hours, the pork will easily shred with a fork. Shred it and mix with the juice in the slow cooker. I like to turn my slow cooker on high and let it sit with the lid off for 15 minutes or so – I find that if it’s extra liquidy, some of the liquid will be absorbed. Stir in the chipotle peppers, the adobo sauce and the peach preserves. Toss well. Cover and let it cook for another 15 to 30 minutes. For an oven method; cook for 2 to 3 hours at 170°C.
- To serve, pile the pork on brioche buns and top with the quick slaw and pickled peaches.
- Pickled Peaches:
- Heat the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, red pepper and peppercorns in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil it for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it cool for 10 minutes. Place the peaches in a jar or bowl and pour the mixture over top. Let the peaches sit for 30 minutes before using. To each, scoop them out with a slotted spoon.
- Quick Slaw:
- Combine the cabbage and cilantro in a bowl. Add in the lime juice, olive oil, salt and pepper and toss well. I like to let this sit for 10 minutes or so before serving.
