ingredients:
- for the dough:
- 11.09|g active dry yeast or instant yeast
- 244|ml milk lukewarm
- 100|g granulated sugar
- 75.67|g butter unsalted, softened, or margarine
- 1|tsp salt
- 2| eggs
- 500|g all-purpose flour
- for the filling:
- 220| g brown sugar packed
- 3| tbsp cinnamon
- 75.67| g butter unsalted, softened, or margarine
- for the cream cheese icing:
- 88.72| g butter unsalted, softened, or margarine
- 180| g powdered sugar also known as icing sugar, or confectioner's sugar
- 56.75| g cream cheese at room temperature
- 0.5| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.13| tsp salt

directions:
- For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk with a tsp of sugar (you can take a tsp out of the 1/2 cup of sugar) in a large bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, it will start to froth up.
- To the bowl of your mixer add the sugar, butter or margarine, salt, eggs, and flour and mix until well incorporated.
- Pour the milk/yeast mixture over the flour mixture and using the dough hook, mix well until well incorporated.
- Place the dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
- Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
- Grease a baking dish with cooking spray or butter.
- Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approximately 16 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approximately 1/4 inch in thickness.
- Spread the 1/3 cup of butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with the sugar evenly over the surface of the dough.
- Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge.
- Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch slices, and place in a lightly greased baking pan. You can also use floss to cut into slices, as seen in the video. Place the cut rolls in the prepared pan. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rise for another 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
- Preheat oven to 170Â°C degrees. 
- Place the baking pan in the oven and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cooking time can vary greatly!
- While the rolls are baking make the icing by mixing all the icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy and smooth.
- When the rolls are done, spread generously with icing.
