time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

notes:
- This makes 3 pie crusts, so freeze the other 2.

ingredients:
- for the crust: 
- 4| cup(s) sifted all-purpose flour
- 1| tbsp sugar
- 3| tsp salt
- 1| large egg, lightly beaten
- 1| tsp white vinegar
- 0.5| cup(s) ice cold water
- 1.5| cup(s) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- for the coconut custard filling:
- 1| cup(s) sugar
- 4| tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 6| large eggs
- 1| cup(s) buttermilk
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 2| cup(s) shredded sweetened coconut
- for the coconut whipped cream:
- 2| cans full-fat coconut milk cold, refrigerated overnight
- 1| tbsp powdered sugar
- 0.25| tsp vanilla extract
- 3| tbsp toasted coconut

directions:
- Crust:
- Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse just until combined. In a small bowl, whisk mix together the egg, vinegar and water. Add the cold butter pieces into the food processor and pulse until small coarse crumbs remain. Sprinkle the water/egg mixture over the flour and pulse again until the dough comes together.
- Remove the dough with your hands and wrap it in plastic wrap. This dough makes enough for 3 pie crusts, so you can either separate it into 3 sections now, or separate it after it’s refrigerated. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.
- After 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 180°C. Roll the pie crust out into a circle. Fold it in half to pick it up and gently place it in the plate, unfolding as you go and trimming any excess off of the edges – you can also use a fork to press the edges down. At this point, I covered my crust with parchment paper, filled it with dry beans *or pie weights* and bake for 10 minutes. Once finished, tap any bubbles on the bottom with a fork.
- Coconut Custard Filling:
- Whisk together the sugar and melted butter until combined. Whisk in the eggs and the buttermilk. Whisk in the vanilla and salt. Fold in the shredded coconut.
- Pour the custard into the pie crust. Bake it for 45 to 50 minutes, until the center isn’t jiggly and the custard is golden brown on top. If needed, you can cover the pie crust edges with foil if they are getting too dark. Let the pie cool completely. Right before serving, make the coconut whipped cream and top the pie with it. Sprinkle on the toasted coconut.
- Coconut Whipped Cream:
- Open the cans and discard the liquid *use it in smoothies*, then scoop the firm coconut meat into the bowl of your electric mixer. Beat on medium-high speed until completely whipped and thick. Beat in the vanilla extract and powdered sugar. Spread it on the cooled pie right before serving. Sprinkle with toasted coconut!
