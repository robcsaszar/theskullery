servings: 1 

ingredients:
- for the flatbread:
- 2| cups all purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 2| teaspoons kosher salt
- 0.75| tsp baking powder
- 0.5| tsp sugar
- 1| cup plain, full-fat yogurt
- 4| tbsp olive oil
- for the toppings:
- 1| cup plain, full-fat yogurt
- 1| garlic clove, finely grated or minced
- kosher salt
- 0.5| stick unsalted butter
- 0.75| teaspoon curry powder
- 8| eggs, cooked sunny-side up, over-easy or poached
- cilantro leaves, for scattering
- flaky sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Add flour, salt, baking powder and sugar to a large bowl, whisking to combine. Add 1 cup yogurt, and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead until a mostly smooth ball of dough forms (1 to 2 minutes). Divide dough into 4 pieces, and shape each into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
- While the dough is resting, prepare some of the toppings. Add 1 cup yogurt, grated garlic and 3/4 tsp kosher salt to a medium bowl, whisking to combine. Season to taste with additional salt. Set aside. 
- Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter turns a deep golden brown color and takes on a nutty aroma (about 5 minutes). Take the saucepan off the heat, and stir in the curry powder and a pinch of salt. Let cool for a moment then season to taste with additional salt. Set aside.
- Place a large, cast-iron skillet over medium heat. While the skillet is heating up, roll 1 ball of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1/8" thick round (doesn't have to be perfect).
- Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the hot skillet (it should smoke a little), then carefully add the dough round. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top starts to bubble and puff (about 2 minutes). Flip and cook until the other side is golden in spots (1 to 1.5 minutes longer). Transfer to a plate, and then repeat this process with the other 3 balls of dough. I like to roll out the next ball while one is cooking in the skillet.
- To serve, slather each flatbread with garlic yogurt, then top with eggs, cilantro leaves and a drizzle of curry brown butter. Finish with a sprinkling of flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
