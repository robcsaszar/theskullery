notes:
- A good substitute for fresh cotija cheese is feta. A good substitute for aged cotija cheese is Parmeggiano Regiano or Pecorino Romano.

ingredients:
- for the corn salad:
- 4| ears corn, shucked
- 1| celery, peeled and diced *or jicama, should you have access to it*
- 0.5| cup(s) chopped cilantro, plus more for serving
- 0.3333| cup(s) sliced green onions
- 0.25| cup(s) crumbled cotija cheese, plus more for topping *see note*
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 0.25| tsp chili powder
- 0.25| tsp smoked paprika
- 1| lime, juiced and zest freshly grated
- for the garlic lime mayo:
- 0.5| cup(s) mayo
- 2| garlic cloves, minced
- 1| lime, juiced
- for serving:
- 8| corn tortillas, warmed
- lime wedges for spritzing

directions:
- Preheat your grill to medium-high. 
- Brush the corn with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
- Place the ears on the grill and cook until the corn is golden or charred – whichever you prefer – turning the ears as you go. It will take about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the corn from the grill and let it cool slightly.
- Once the corn is cool, slice the kernels off the cob. In a large bowl, stirl together the corn, jicama, cilantro, green onions, cotija, chili powder, paprika salt and pepper. Stir in the lime zest and juice.
- Drizzle the garlic mayo on the tortilla. Add a few spoonfuls of the corn salad mixture on top. You can drizzle more of the mayo on if you wish! 
- Top with more cotija cheese and cilantro and serve.
