servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1| red onion, diced
- 1| red bell pepper, diced
- 1| orange bell pepper, diced
- 4| garlic cloves, minced
- 1| tsp pepper
- 1| tsp kosher salt
- 1.5| pounds ground beef
- 3| tbsp tomato paste
- 3| tbsp chili powder
- 1| tbsp brown sugar
- 1| tbsp cumin
- 1| tbsp dried oregano
- 2| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 0.25| tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1| can crushed tomatoes
- 1| ounce can fire roasted tomatoes
- 2| cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 0.75| cup(s) dark chocolate ice cream

directions:
- Heat a large pot over medium- low heat and add the olive oil. 
- Add in the onions, peppers and garlic along with the salt and pepper. 
- Stir and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until translucent. Add in the ground beef and break it apart with a wooden spoon. 
- Increase the heat to medium and brown the beef until all the fat is rendered. I cook it a bit longer so some of that fat cooks off too.
- Stir in the tomato paste, chili powder, sugar, cumin, oregano, paprika, red pepper and nutmeg until combined. Cook for 5 minutes. 
- Add in the crushed tomatoes, fire roasted tomatoes and pinto beans. Bring the mixer to a simmer. 
- Simmer, stirring often, for 30 to 45 minutes. Stir in the chocolate ice and simmer for another 15 minutes. Serve with your favorite toppings.
