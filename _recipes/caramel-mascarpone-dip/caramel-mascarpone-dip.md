directions:
- Bourbon Caramel:
- Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to combine, then cook and stir until the mixture is bubbling. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes until it slightly thickens and is smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature â€“ it will thicken as it cools.
- Dip:
- While the caramel is cooling, stir together the mascarpone cheese, sugar and vanilla extract until combined and smooth. Spread it in a pie dish. Place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. By this time, the caramel should be close to room temperature. Pour the caramel on top of the mascarpone layer and place it back in the fridge for 1 hour.
- After 1 hour, sprinkle the cashews on top. Add a sprinkle of cinnamon. Drizzle on the extra caramel if you'd like. Serve with sliced apples.
