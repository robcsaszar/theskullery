directions:
- Heat a large stock pot over medium-low heat and add the olive oil.
- Add in the onions and garlic with the salt and pepper and stir. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 to 6 minutes.
- Add in the carrots and celery, cooking for 5 minutes more.
- Add in the parmesan rind, beans, tomatoes, stock, basil and oregano and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce it to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.
- After 20 minutes, add in the ditalini pasta. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through. Toss in the fresh spinach.
- Serve the soup with a few drizzles of the kale pesto and freshly shaved parmesan.
- Kale Pesto:
- Place the kale, herbs, garlic, cheese, pistachios, salt and pepper in a food processor. Pulse until combined and small pieces remain.
- Stream in the olive oil with the processor running until the mixture comes together. You can always add in more olive oil if you want the pesto thinner.
