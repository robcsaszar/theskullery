ingredients:
- for the pretzel chicken:
- 1.5| pounds boneless skinless chicken tenders
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 2| cups mini pretzel twists crushed
- 1| tsp garlic powder
- 2| eggs lightly beaten
- for the hot honey:
- 0.5| cup(s) honey
- 1| jalapeño pepper, thinly sliced
- for the sauce:
- 0.5| cup(s) mayonnaise
- 2| tbsp dijon mustard
- 1| tbsp yellow mustard
- 1| tbsp honey
- 1| tbsp your favorite BBQ sauce

directions:
- Pretzel Chicken:
- Preheat the oven to 220°C. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Spray the rack with nonstick spray.
- Season the chicken tendres with the salt and pepper. Place the pretzels in a food processor and blend until mostly fine crumbs remain. Place the pretzels in a bowl. Stir in the garlic powder.
- In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs.
- Take each chicken tender and coat it in the beaten egg. Dredge it through the pretzel crumbs, pressing gently so the crumbs adhere. Place the tender on the rack and repeat with remaining - chicken. Once all the chicken is finished, spray it with avocado or olive oil spray.
- Bake the chicken for 12 minutes. Flip it gently and spray the other side with the oil spray. Bake for another 10 to 12 minutes.
- Let cool slightly before serving with the house sauce and hot honey.
- Hot Honey:
- Heat the honey and the jalapeños in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Let the honey come to a light simmer then turn off the honey. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Strain the honey through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the peppers and the seeds.
- Sauce:
- Whisk all ingredients together until creamy and smooth and combined. This stores great in the fridge for a few days.
