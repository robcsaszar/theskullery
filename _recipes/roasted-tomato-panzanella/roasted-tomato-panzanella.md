servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 4| cup(s) grape tomatoes
- 4| cup(s) cubed multigrain bread
- 6| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tsp salt
- 1| tsp pepper
- 2.5| cup(s) fresh mozzarella balls/pearls
- fresh basil leaves
- balsamic glaze

directions:
- Preheat oven to 200Â°C. On one baking sheet, lay the tomatoes down and drizzle with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 
- On a separate baking sheet, place the cubed bread and toss it with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Place both sheets in the oven. 
- Roast the tomatoes for a full 20 minutes, tossing once during cooking. Toast the bread for 10-12 minutes, until golden, tossing 2-3 times during cooking.
- Place mozzarella on a paper towel to remove a bit of the moisture and water. 
- Chop any larger basil leaves, leaving the smaller ones intact if desired.
- In a large bowl, add bread, tomatoes, basil, remaining salt and pepper. 
- Gently toss with two large spoons, trying to keep the tomatoes intact for pretty visual purposes. 
- Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the salad, and then add on a liberal drizzle of balsamic glaze. Serve immediately.
