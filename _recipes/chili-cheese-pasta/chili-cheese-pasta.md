time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| sweet onion, diced
- 2| garlic cloves, minced
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 1| pound lean ground beef
- 2| tbsp tomato paste
- 1| tbsp chili powder
- 2| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp ground cumin
- 1| can fire roasted tomatoes
- 1| can diced green chiles
- 2.5| cup(s) low-sodium beef or chicken stock
- 8| oz elbow noodles
- 6| oz white cheddar cheese, freshly grated
- 3| green onions, thinly sliced
- sour cream, for serving

directions:
- Heat a large pot over medium-low heat and add the olive oil. Stir in the onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook until the onions soften, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. 
- Cook, stirring often, until the beef is browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. At this time I like to keep breaking the beef apart. I also occasionally increase the heat in order to cook off some of the fat from the beef.
- Once the beef is browned, stir in the tomato paste, chili powder, paprika and cumin. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring often. Pour in the tomatoes, green chiles and stock (or water). Add in the pasta. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then cover the pot and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
- The pasta should absorb all the liquid and plump up! You don't want the heat too high, because the pasta can stick on the bottom. If it needs a few more minutes, keep the pot covered.
- Once the pasta is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed, stir in the cheddar cheese. Taste and season additionally if needed.
- Serve immediately with sliced green onions and if you're really feeling it, sour cream for serving.
