time: under 60mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsps butter or olive oil
- for the egg mixture:
- 3| large eggs
- pinch of garlic salt
- pinch of Tajín, or other chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix
- pinch of black pepper
- pinch of nutmeg *optional*
- 2| tbsps half and half *optional*
- for the fillings:
- 1| heaping handful of spinach *not frozen or canned*
- 1| cup baby bella mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 0.5| large red onion, diced
- 0.5| cup sharp cheddar, shredded
- 3| thin slices Gruyère *optional*
- 0.25| tsp paprika

directions:
- Soak the mushrooms in a ramekin filled with water for 3 minutes, to prevent any brown residue from forming.
- In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt mixtures, pepper, nutmeg, and half and half, until even and glossy.
- Place half the butter or olive oil on a shallow 10-inch (25-cm) cast iron skillet on medium heat, or a similarly sized nonstick omelet pan or skillet. Tilt and move the pan to coat evenly.
- Add mushrooms, paprika, and onions, and sauté until lightly browned. Add spinach, and toss for 30 seconds, or until slightly wilted, but still crunchy.
- Set aside the mushrooms, onions, paprika, and spinach. Alternatively, push them into a mound in the center, or ring abutting the walls, of the skillet, ensuring plenty of empty space.
- Add the remaining half of the butter or olive oil to the pan and stir contents thoroughly to coat evenly. Lower the heat.
- Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, tilting and moving to ensure a flat layer of eggs. Heat until the eggs have become light and fluffy on top.
- If you set aside the mushrooms, onions, paprika, and spinach, add them back into the pan, coating the top of the eggs evenly.
- Sprinkle the cheese over the omelette.
- Gently push the edges of the omelette toward the center of the skillet with two spatulas, making sure not to break it. Turn the heat off.
- Gently scrape and lift half the omelette off the pan and fold onto the other half with the spatulas. Carefully lift the whole folded omelette onto plate and serve.
