time: over 120mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

notes:
- Using just 00 flour is perfectly fine. We're using a combination of the two since the 00 flour has a lower amount of protein, starch, and gluten than the all-purpose flour so we're just trying to add a bit more body to out pizza dough.

ingredients:
- 153|g 00 flour *see note*
- 153|g all-purpose flour *see note*
- 8|g fine sea salt
- 2|g active dry yeast
- 4|g extra-virgin olive oil
- 1| tsp honey or roasted sugar

directions:
- In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.
- In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
- Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours *best results at 24+ hours* in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 1-2 hours before you begin to shape it for pizza.)
- To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.
