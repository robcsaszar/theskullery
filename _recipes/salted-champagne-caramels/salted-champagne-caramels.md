time: over 120mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 1| cup(s) heavy cream
- 4| tbsp unsalted butter
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.3333| cup(s) of your favorite champagne
- 1.5| cup(s) white granulated sugar
- 0.25| cup(s) corn syrup
- 0.5| tsp vanilla extract
- 1| cup(s) kettle cooked potato chips, crushed into crumbs
- metallic sprinkles
- parchment paper for wrapping

directions:
- Line an baking dish with parchment paper and spray it lightly with nonstick spray.
- Place the butter and cream in a saucepan and heat until the butter melts and the mixture is warm. Remove it from the heat.
- In a large saucepan, stir together the champagne, sugar and corn syrup over medium heat until it’s combined – the mixture will be thick. Fit the pot with a candy thermometer. Do not stir – bring the mixture to a boil and let it cook until it reaches a golden and caramely color – about 150°C. You can let it go as high as 160°C, but no higher. 
- Turn off the heat under the sugar and very slowly pour in the cream and butter mixture while whisking. The mixture will bubble up and triple in size. 
- Return it to the heat, and heat until it’s about 120°C. Turn the heat off. Gently stir in the vanilla extract.
- Pour the caramel into the lined baking dish and tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove any bubbles. Let it sit overnight (or even just 4 to 6 hours) – I loosely covered mine with a piece of foil. While the caramel sets, cut some parchment paper into squares – the amount you need will depend on the size and shape of your caramels.
- When ready to cut, lift the caramel square out by the parchment paper on the sides. You can cover it with sprinkles and chip crumbs first, but I like to cut mine and then cover. Make them whatever size or shape you want. 
- Sprinkle with metallic sprinkles and potato chips, gently pressing to adhere if needed. Wrap each caramel in a piece of parchment paper and twist the ends.
