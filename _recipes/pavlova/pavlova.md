notes: 
- Separate the egg whites when theyâ€™re cold, itâ€™s much easier.
- In order to make a stable meringue after you separated the egg whites, bring them to room temperature.
- Make sure your bowl is very clean and there is no any water or grease, otherwise youâ€™ll not be able to rich stiff peaks.
- The meringue without the cream can be stored up to 3 days in room temperature.

ingredients:
- for the meringue:
- 140|g egg whites *aprox. 40g/egg*
- 200|g caster sugar
- pinch of salt
- 2| tsp cornstarch
- 2| tsp white wine vinegar
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- for the cream:
- 360|ml heavy cream *cold*
- 3| tbsps powdered sugar
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- strawberries, raspberries, blueberries *any kind of semi-tart fruit fits perfectly*

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 160Â°C (320Â°F).
- Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray and mark, a 20cm (8-inch) circle. Turn it upside down and set it aside.
- In a large bowl whisk egg whites until soft peaks form, gradually add sugar, until stiff peaks form and the meringue looks glossy. Add white wine vinegar, cornstarch, vanilla extract and beat on low speed until incorporated.
- Spread the meringue inside the circle, creating a crater by making the sides a little higher than the middle.
- Place the pavlova in the oven, reduce the heat to 120C (250F). Bake for 75 minutes, then turn off the heat and let the Pavlova cool completely (at least 4 hours) inside the oven.
- To make the cream, place heavy cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat to stiff peaks.
- Spread whipped cream on top of the pavlova and decorate with fresh strawberries.
