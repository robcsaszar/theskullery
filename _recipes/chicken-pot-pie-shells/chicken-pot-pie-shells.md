servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 1| box jumbo pasta shells
- 5| tbsp butter divided
- 1| medium onion(s) peeled and diced
- 2| cloves garlic minced
- 2| lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 0.5| cup(s) all purpose flour
- 2| cups no sodium chicken stock
- 1.5| cups milk
- 4| cups shredded mozzarella
- 0.25| cup(s) finely chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
- 10| oz bag frozen peas
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1| cup(s) finely grated parmesan

directions:
- In a large sauté pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and translucent.
- Add the chicken and lightly sear, then melt in the remaining butter. When melted, sprinkle in the flour and stir until the chicken is coated evenly.
- Add the chicken stock in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Stir in the milk and let simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
- Add 3 cups of the shredded mozzarella and the parsley. Stir until the cheese is melted, then season generously with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
- While the filling is cooling, cook the shells in a large pot of salted water over high heat. Cook to the package instructions for baking (usually 2-3 minutes less than al dente) - they will continue to cook as you bake them. When the shells are cooked, drain them and shock them in cold tap water. Drain well.
- Heat the oven to 180°C. Spread out a generous amount of sauce in the bottom of a large baking dish.
- Stir the frozen peas into the remaining sauce.
- Stuff each shell with a generous amount of filling, placing the stuffed shells in the sauced dish. Top the shells with any remaining sauce and remaining shredded mozzarella and the parmesan.
- Bake the dish for 30-45 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and cheese is golden. Remove and let cool slightly before enjoying.
