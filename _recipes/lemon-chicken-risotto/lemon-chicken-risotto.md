ingredients:
- 1| pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp garlic powder
- 0.5| tsp lemon pepper seasoning
- 2| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1.5| cup(s) arborio rice
- 3| garlic cloves, minced
- 1| cup(s) dry white wine
- 5| cup(s) low-sodium chicken stock, warmed
- 1| tsp freshly grated lemon zest
- 4| scallions, sliced into 1-inch long pieces
- 0.25| cup(s) freshly grated parmesan cheese
- 1| tbsp fresh chopped basil, plus extra for topping
- 1| tbsp fresh chopped parsley, plus extra for topping
- salt and pepper for seasoning
- lemon wedges for serving

directions:
- Pat the chicken completely dry with paper towels. Season with the salt, garlic powder and lemon pepper. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook on both sides until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and plate it on a cutting board. Once cool, slice into pieces.
- With the saucepan still hot, add the butter. Add the rice and stirring often, toast the rice until it’s somewhat translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute. - Stir in the white wine, constantly stirring or at least stirring every minute or so, until the rice absorbs the wine. Once the wine is absorbed, add in 1.5 cups of the stock, stirring until the rice absorbs the liquid like it did with the wine. 
- Repeat this 2 to 3 more times, until all stock has been added and the rice is al dente. You want it to appear “hydrated” – and want there to be some liquid left when serving. This process should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
- Stir in the scallions, lemon zest, parmesan, basil and parsley. Taste and season the rice additionally, more salt or pepper if needed. This will differ on the salt level in your stock, so don’t be afraid to add more. Stir in the sliced chicken. Serve immediately with extra chopped herbs on top and lemon wedges on the side.
