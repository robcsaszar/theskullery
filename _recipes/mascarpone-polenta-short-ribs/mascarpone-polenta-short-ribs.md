servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 12| beef short ribs
- 1| tsp salt
- 1| tsp pepper
- 3| tbsp flour
- 2| tbsp canola or vegetable oil
- 0.33| cup(s) your favorite Cabernet
- fresh chopped herbs, for garnish
- for the mascarpone polenta: 
- 4| cup(s) low-sodium chicken stock
- 0.75| cup(s) polenta coarse grind cornmeal
- 2| tbsp unsalted butter
- 0.66| cup(s) mascarpone cheese
- 4| oz pecorino Romano cheese freshly grated
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Sprinkle the short ribs with the salt, pepper and flour. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the short ribs in batches and sear until golden brown on all sides. Deglaze the pan with the cabernet. Place the short ribs and liquid in the slow cooker and repeat with remaining ribs.
- Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours. For oven method, cook for 2 to 3 hours @ 170°C covered.
- Remove the ribs from the slow cooker *keep the juices* and place them on a plate to cool so you can handle them comfortably. 
- Once slightly cooler, pull the beef off the bone and remove and bits of fat if desired. Place all the shredded beef back into the slow cooker and into the juices. Set the crockpot back on low or warm and toss well. The ribs are ready to eat at this point, but I like to let them soak up the juice for about 30 minutes.
- Mascarpone Polenta:
- About 30 minutes before serving the short ribs, bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly whisk in the polenta Turn the heat down to medium low and continue to stir until the mixture thickens. Once the mixture has come together and the cornmeal is thoroughly combined, reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook until the polenta is creamy and resembles the consistency of oatmeal, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes. If at any time the polenta looks parched, dry or too thick, add in some extra chicken stock ¼ cup(s) at a time. After 30 minutes, stir in the butter, cheeses, salt and pepper. Taste and add more seasoning or cheese if desired.
- To serve, scoop the polenta into a bowl. Top with the shredded short ribs and chopped fresh herbs. Serve immediately.
