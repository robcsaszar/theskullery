ingredients:
- 4| tbsp butter or olive oil
- 1| large lavash or yufka sheet
- 1| tbsp water
- 5| thin slices sirloin or flank steak, preferably pre-cooked, seasoned with garlic salt, chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix, cumin and ground black pepper
- 4| tbsp hummus
- for the omelet: 
- 2| large eggs
- 1| pinch of garlic salt
- 1| pinch of chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix
- 1| pinch of ground black pepper
- 1| pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- 2| tbsp half and half (optional)
- 1| handful of spinach (not frozen or canned)
- 0.5| cup baby bella or Crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 0.25| cup sharp cheddar, shredded
- 0.25| tsp paprika
- for the hash browns:
- 1| grated potato
- 2| cups water
- 0.5| small red onion or large shallot, diced
- 1| pinch of garlic salt
- 1| pinch of chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix
- 1| pinch of ground black pepper



directions:
- Lightly sprinkle the lavash or yufka with the tablespoon of water to ensure its flexibility. Lightly toast on a cast-iron skillet or in a toaster oven, until browned on edges. When done, set aside.
- Soak the grated potatoes in 2 cups water in a large bowl. Let sit for 3 minutes, then stir thoroughly. Drain the bowl of water. Repeat once.
- Put the potatoes in a large mesh strainer and shake gently in a horizontal motion to remove excess starch and water. Set aside to dry.
- For the directions for the omelette, see [here](https://theskullery.net/recipes/spinach-mushroom-omelette). *make sure to adjust for the new portions (and lack of onions) specified above*
- Put the remaining half of the butter or olive oil in the skillet. Dump the potatoes, onions, and steak slices in, covering the bottom of the skillet fully and evenly. Season the potatoes and onions. Sear them to desired brownness and crunch, taking care to flip them over.
- Assemble the d√ºr√ºm by laying the lavash or yufka flat, shorter sides facing you, and spreading the hummus evenly on the half farthest away from you. Pile hash browns, steak, and omelette evenly on the nearest half. Gently pinch and fold the nearest edge over, then roll into an at least 2-inch (5-cm) thick cylinder.
