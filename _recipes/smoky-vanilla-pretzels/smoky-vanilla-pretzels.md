ingredients:
- 1| bag mini pretzel twists
- 0.5| cup unsalted butter, melted

- 1| tsp smoked paprika

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 150°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread the pretzels all over both sheets. You don’t want to layer them.
- In a bowl, whisk together the melted butter, bourbon, sugar, vanilla paste, paprika, garlic and pepper flakes. Pour it over the pretzels and use your hands to toss everything together really well. 
- Place the pretzels in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Toss and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove and let cool completely on the sheets. Store these in mason jars or even resealable containers or bags.
