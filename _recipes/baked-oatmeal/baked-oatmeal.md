ingredients:
- 4.5| cup(s) quick oats
- 0.75| cup(s) sugar
- 0.5| tsp baking powder
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 3| large eggs
- 2| cup(s) milk whatever you like! dairy or nondairy
- 0.75| cup(s) canola oil
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.25| cup(s) chocolate chips
- 0.33| cup(s) sliced almonds
- 0.33| cup(s) flaked coconut toasted if you've like!
- 2| tablespoons hemp hearts
- 1| tablespoon chia seeds
- milk or cream for drizzling

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170Â°C. Spray a baking dish with nonstick spray.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla extract. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until combined. Pour the mixture in the dish.
- Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and set. Remove the dish from the oven and place the chocolate chips on top right away (so they kind of melt!). Top with the coconut, almonds, hemp hearts and chia seeds. 
- Let cool slightly, then cut into squares and serve with a drizzle of milk or cream.
