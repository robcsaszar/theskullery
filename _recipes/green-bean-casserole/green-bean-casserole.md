notes: 
- If you don't have any chicken or turkey broth you can go ahead and use water + boullion cubes or store-bought. There's a big difference flavor-wise between the three, keep that in mind. 
- To test to see if your oil is ready for frying, dip the handle of a wooden spoon in the oil and if it bubbles around the handle then it's ready. # (you can add recipe notes here, if you don't have any just delete this whole section and it won't be processed)


ingredients:
- for the condensed mushroom soup:
- 90|g butter
- 0.5|kg mushrooms *finely chopped*
- 1| medium-sized onion(s) *finely diced or French cut*
- 1| clove(s) garlic
- 90|g all-purpose flour
- 200|ml heavy cream
- 200|ml chicken or turkey broth *see notes*
- salt & pepper *to taste*
- for the crispy onions:
- 400|ml Sana (a.k.a. Buttermilk)
- 3| medium-sized onion(s) *thinly sliced or French cut*
- 500|g all-purpose flour
- 1|tbsp sweet or smoked paprika
- oil *enough for deep frying*
- salt & pepper *to taste*
- for the green beans:
- 500|g frozen green beans



directions:
- Condensed Mushroom Soup:
- Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. 
- Add mushrooms and onions and sauté for about 8 minutes until tender. 
- Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. 
- Add flour and cook for another 2 minutes. 
- Quickly stir the cream and chicken stock until smooth. 
- Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute. 
- Take it off the heat and try the seasoning and adjust if necessary (you want it to be saltier than normal as it is a condensed soup and you're going to combine it with the beans later on).
- Crispy Onions: 
- Soak sliced onions in Sana/Buttermilk for at least 10 minutes.
- In a shallow dish add flour, salt, pepper, and ppaprika and mix well.
- In a large/deep dish heat up your oil. *see note* 
- Dredge buttermilk soaked onions in flour until well coated and add to your oil, frying in batches until golden brown.
- Remove form oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a papertowel-lined plate.
- You can store them in an airtight container in a dry cool place for up to a few days if you're not using them in the next step.
- Casserole: 
- Preheat your oven to 180°C.
- Lay out your frozen green beans on a baking sheet, sprinkle some olive oil and put them in the oven for 5-10 minutes. They need to be unthawed and par-cooked.
- Get them out of the oven, combine them with the mushroom soup and sprinkle on your crispy onions on top.
