notes:
- It’s important to note that the flavor of the mashed potato pancakes depends greatly on how your mashed potatoes were made. If they are seasoned enough for eating (i.e. like you ate them with dinner a night or so ago, so they have salt, pepper, etc in them), then you don’t need to add any additional salt and pepper. If you make mashed potatoes just for these cakes, be sure to season them liberally, as you would when serving mashed potatoes.
- These are **amazing** with baked beans.

ingredients:
- 3| slices bacon, thick cut
- 3| cup(s) mashed potatoes *see note*
- salt and pepper, if needed
- 5| tbsp all-purpose flour
- 3| ounces irish aged cheddar cheese, like Kerrygold Dubliner
- 0.25| tsp garlic powder
- 3| green onions, thinly sliced
- 0.25| cup(s) chopped chives
- 2| tbsp bacon grease, butter or olive oil
- 0.5| cup(s) plain greek yogurt or sour cream, for serving

directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add the bacon. Cook, stirring often, until the fat is rendered and it’s crispy. Turn the heat off under the skillet and transfer the bacon to a paper towel.
- Place the mashed potatoes in large bowl and sprinkle on 5 tbsp of flour along with the garlic powder. Mix the flour into the potatoes and if you can easily form cakes with the potatoes, you’re all set! If you still need something to bind the mixture more, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time.
- Stir in about three quarters of the cheddar cheese, along with three quarters of the green onions and chives. You want to have a bit reserved for topping.
- Heat the same skillet over medium high heat. I just use the bacon grease that is already in the skillet, but you can remove it and use butter or oil instead. Add the potato pancakes and let them brown on each side, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. It’s important not to crowd the pan because it will be difficult to get the pancakes out without smashing them. Use a stainless spatula or something firm to lift them up and transfer them to plates.
- Once the potatoes are served, top with remaining cheese, green onions and chives. Serve with plain greek yogurt or sour cream!
