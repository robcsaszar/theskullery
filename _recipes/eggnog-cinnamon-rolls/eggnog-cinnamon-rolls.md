ingredients:
- for the cinnamon rolls:
- 2.75| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 2| tbsp sugar
- 2.25| tsp active dry yeast
- 0.3333| cup(s) eggnog
- 0.25| cup(s) unsalted butter
- 0.25| cup(s) water
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp cinnamon
- 2| large eggs
- for the filling:
- 6| tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 0.3333| cup(s) sugar
- 1| tsp cinnamon
- 0.25| tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- for the eggnog glaze:
- 2| cup(s) powdered sugar
- 0.25| cup(s) eggnog
- 0.25| tsp freshly grated nutmeg

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170°C.
- In the bowl of your electric mixer, stir together 2 cup(s) of the flour, sugar and yeast.
- Place the milk and butter in a small saucepan and heat over low heat just until the butter melts. Remove from the stovetop and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the water and vanilla extract. With the dough hook attached to your mixer, stir in the milk and butter mixture until combined. Add the salt, cinnamon and the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough will be very sticky. 
- Add the remaining 3/4 cup(s) flour gradually, beating for another 2 to 3 minutes until the dough comes together again. It should still be stick. Place it in a bowl and let it sit for 10 minutes.
- After 10 minutes, roll it out on a floured surface to a rectangle. Add the filling - add the melted butter on the dough. Whisk together the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and sprinkle it all over top. Starting with one of the long sides, roll it up tightly. Slice the roll into 1-inch cinnamon rolls. Place them in a baking dish. Let them sit for 5 minutes.
- Bake the cinnamon rolls for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown on top. Remove and cover with the eggnog glaze.
- Eggnog Glaze:
- Whisk ingredients together until a smooth glaze forms. If it’s too thick, add more eggnog 1 tsp at a time. If it’s too thin, whisk in more sugar a few tbsp at a time until desired consistency is reached.
