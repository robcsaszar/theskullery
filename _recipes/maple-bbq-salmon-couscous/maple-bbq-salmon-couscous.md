servings: 1 

ingredients:
- for the salmon:
- 2| pounds salmon filets
- 1| tbsp brown (or maple!) sugar
- 1| tsp garlic powder
- 1| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 0.25| tsp cumin
- 2| tbsp maple syrup
- for the brown butter couscous:
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| cup(s) uncooked pearl couscous
- 1.25| cup(s) chicken or vegetable stock or water
- pinch of salt
- 2| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| garlic clove(s), minced

directions:
- Salmon:
- Preheat the oven to 200°C. Place the salmon on a baking sheet.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper and cumin. Sprinkle it all over the salmon filets. Drizzle each filet with the maple syrup and use a spoon to kind of “spread” it all over the filet.
- Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the salmon just flakes with a fork. If desired, you can brush with a little more maple syrup when it comes out of the oven. Top with chopped chives. Serve immediately with brown butter couscous!
- Brown Butter Couscous:
- Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add the butter. Stir in the couscous until coated, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring, until the couscous is slightly toasty. Add in the stock and salt and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.
- While the couscous is cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add the butter. Cook, whisking often, until brown bits appear on the bottom of the pan. Remove the butter from the heat and stir in the garlic cloves.
- Once the couscous is finished, drizzle with the garlic brown butter. Toss and serve.
