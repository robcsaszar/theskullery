time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| pounds small-ish potatoes, scrubbed
- 3| tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1| cup(s) heavy cream
- 3| garlic cloves, smashed
- 0.5| cup(s) sour cream *labneh is amazing instead, but not accessible everywhere*
- 0.25| cup(s) finely chopped chives, divided
- 3| tbsp finely chopped dill, divided

directions:
- Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat.
- Place potatoes in a large bowl, and drizzle melted butter. Season with a few pinches of kosher salt and several turns of black pepper, tossing to combine. Tip out potatoes on to the center of a large sheet of aluminum foil. Place an equal-sized sheet of foil on top and tightly seal the edges.
- Carefully place the foil packet directly over the heat, cover the grill and cook for 10 minutes. Try to maintain a temperature of 400Â°F inside the grill. Carefully flip the foil packet, and continue to cook until the potatoes are very tender (about 10 to 15 minutes more).
- While the potatoes are cooking, bring cream and garlic to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until the cream has thickened a bit (about 10 minutes), stirring occasionally. Keep a watchful eye here, because the cream can boil over. Season to taste with salt and a lot of black pepper. Take the cream off the heat, strain out the garlic and set aside. Rewarm before adding to the potatoes if needed.
- Open the foil packet, place potatoes on a cutting board, and using the bottom of a glass or small bowl, gently smash each of the potatoes. Place smashed potatoes in a large bowl, then add warm cream, labneh, 2 tablespoons chopped chives and 2 tablespoons chopped dill, gently mixing to combine. 
- The texture should be on the rustic side. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then top with remaining herbs and bit more black pepper.
