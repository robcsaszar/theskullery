time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

notes:
- To toast the pine nuts, I add mine to a skillet and heat over low heat. I shake and stir until the are golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes.

ingredients:
- 2| pounds skirt steak
- 0.25 cup(s) olive oil
- 2| tbsp brown sugar
- 4| garlic cloves, minced
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp pepper
- for the avocado pesto:
- 4| cup(s)  fresh basil
- 1| avocado
- 0.5| cup(s) asiago cheese
- 0.25| cup(s) toasted pine nuts *see note*
- 3| garlic cloves
- 0.5| to 3/4  cup(s) olive oil
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 0.25| tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- for the grilled corn relish:
- 3| ears sweet corn, cut from the cob
- 0.5| red bell pepper, diced
- 1| shallot, diced
- 0.25| cup(s) chopped fresh cilantro
- 1| lime, juiced
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp pepper

directions:
- In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, brown sugar, garlic, salt and pepper. Place the steak in a baking dish or ziplock bag and pour the mixture over top. Place it in the fridge and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or even overnight.
- Remove the steak about 30 minutes before I cook it.
- You can grill, broil or pan sear it to your liking. Broiling or grilling I find easiest. Preheat the broiler in your oven and move the oven rack as close as possible. Place the steak on a broiler pan or baking sheet and broil on each side for about 5 minutes. This usually results in a medium doneness in my oven â€“ but since the edges are thinner, they tend to be more well done.
- Allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain. Serve with spoonfuls of the pesto and the corn relish on top.
- Avocado Pesto:
- To make the pesto, combine the basil, avocado, cheese, pine nuts and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until small crumbs remain, and then with the processor running, stream in the olive oil. Start with the provided quantity and add the extra if needed to reach the desired consistency. 
- Add the salt, pepper and pepper flakes and blend again. Taste and season additionally if needed.
- Grilled Corn Relish:
- Stir all ingredients together in a bowl until combined. You can make this a bit ahead of time if needed! It stays great in the fridge for a day or two.
