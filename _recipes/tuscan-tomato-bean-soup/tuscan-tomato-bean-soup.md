notes:
- If you have dry beans, soak them overnight instead.

ingredients:
- 1| pound canned white beans (navy, cannellini, etc) *see note*
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| sweet onion, diced
- 4| garlic cloves, minced
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp freshly cracked pepper
- 0.25| tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 0.75| cup(s) chopped or sliced carrots
- 2| tbsp tomato paste
- 2| 14 oz cans fire roasted diced tomatoes
- 4| cup(s) vegetable stock
- 2.5| cup(s) crusty italian bread chunks
- 0.5| cup(s) freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
- 1| parmesan cheese rind
- 1| head tuscan kale, torn from stems and coarsely chopped

directions:
- To soak the beans overnight, place them in a large bowl or pot and cover them with a few inches of water. Drain the beans in the morning.
- Heat a large pot over medium heat and add the butter and olive oil. Stir in the onion, garlic, salt, pepper and pepper flakes. Cook until the onions soften, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in the carrots and cook for 5 minutes more. Stir in the tomato paste, stirring to coat all the vegetables in the pot.
- Add the diced tomatoes and vegetable stock. Add the bread in chunks. Stir in the beans, parmesan cheese and parmesan rind. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and cover it. Cook for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. If it is, reduce the heat!
- When the soup is finished, the bread will have mostly disintegrated into the soup. You can taste and season the soup here if you wish - add more salt and pepper if it doesnâ€™t seem to have enough flavor. This step is important! All canned tomatoes can be different in salt quantities, so be sure to taste and adjust the flavor to your linking.
- 5 to 10 minutes before serving, stir in the kale. I love that the kale has a crisp chew and texture to it. If you prefer it to be softer and more wilted, you can add it in earlier or cook the soup a bit longer. The kale gets softer as it sits.
- Serve the soup with lots of grated Parmesan for topping.
