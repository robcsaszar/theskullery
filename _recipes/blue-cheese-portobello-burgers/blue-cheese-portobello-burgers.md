servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsp olive oil
- 4| large portobello mushroom caps, stems removed
- 2| garlic cloves, minced
- 1| tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 6| oz blue cheese, plus more for topping
- 4| large pieces butter lettuce
- 2| ears grilled corn
- 4| english muffins or buns of your choice
- for the crispy shallots:
- 2| large shallots, peeled and sliced
- 0.75| cup(s) flour
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp garlic powder
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- vegetable or canola oil

directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the mushroom caps and toss so they are coated in the oil, the stir in the garlic. Cook the mushrooms for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until they are tender and juicy. Add the balsamic vinegar into the skillet and toss the mushrooms. 
- Reduce the heat to low, sprinkle salt and pepper on the caps, and then fill the inside of the cap with 1 oz or so of blue cheese. Cover the skillet just until the cheese melts.
- To serve the burger, place a piece of butter lettuce on the bottom of the english muffin. Top with the mushroom, then extra blue cheese. Add the onions and the grilled corn. Serve immediately.
- Crispy Shallots:
- Heat about 2 inches of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. You want the heat to be about 175°CF, but after a few minutes of heating, I’ll test it out by throwing a shallot slice in. 
- While the oil is heating, stir together the flour, salt, paprika, garlic powder and pepper. Dredge the shallot slices through the flour. Once coated, add them in batches to the oil. 
- Fry until just golden and crispy, then remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain excess grease. Repeat with remaining batches.
