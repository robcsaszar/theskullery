notes:
- cheapest I'd strongly suggest would be Disarrono Originale or Luxardo
- this cocktail is the sum of its parts, so I'd suggest going for quality ingredients

- 22.5|ml bourbon

- for garnish:
- Maraschino cherries

directions:
- Dry shake (without ice) everything for about a minute *Jeffrey himself suggests using a [blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIJeLkTthiQ) for a few seconds for better results*.

- Garnish with cherries and a few drops of Angostura bitters.
