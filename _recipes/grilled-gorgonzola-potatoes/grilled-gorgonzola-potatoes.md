servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes, halved
- 2| tbsp olive oil
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp pepper
- 0.5| tsp garlic powder
- 0.5| cup(s) crumbled gorgonzola cheese
- 2| tbsp chopped chives
- 1| tbsp chopped fresh herbs (dill, parsley, basil, oregano, whatever you love!)
- handful arugula micro greens

directions:
- Preheat your grill to the highest heat. Let it heat for at least 15 minutes – it should read over 220°C.
- While the grill is heating, layer two sheets of foil. Fold up the edges (you can see this is in my photos above!) to create a barrier of sorts. Place the potatoes in the foil pack and drizzle on the olive oil. 
- Sprinkle on the salt, pepper and garlic powder. Toss well, coating every potato. I place the foil pack on a baking sheet so it’s easy to transport out to the grill.
- Place the foil pack on the grill (do not cover the top with foiand close the grill. As a personal preference, I like most of the potatoes to start cut-side down so they get crisp on that flat edge. 
- Grill for 15 to 20 minutes, tossing every five minutes or so, until the potatoes are fork tender and getting a bit crisp. 
- Once the potatoes are tender, sprinkle on the gorgonzola and cover the grill for 1 minute. 
- Remove the foil pack and sprinkle on all the fresh herbs. Serve immediately!
