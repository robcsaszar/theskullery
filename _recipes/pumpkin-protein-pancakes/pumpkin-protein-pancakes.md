servings: 8 

ingredients:
- for the pumpkin puree:
- 1| pie pumpkin
- a few spoonfuls of water if needed
- for the pancakes:
- 2| large eggs
- 1| cup(s) old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1| scoop collagen peptides powder
- 2| tbsp honey
- 1| tbsp baking powder
- 0.5| tsp cinnamon
- 0.25| tsp ground cloves
- 0.25| tsp cardamom
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| cup(s) hazelnut milk
- dark chocolate chunks
- sliced almonds, for garnish
- maple syrup or honey

directions:
- Pumpkin Puree:
- Preheat the oven to 190°C.
- Slice the stem off the pumpkin and cut in half. If it’s large enough, cut it in half once or twice more. Remove the seeds with a spoon.
- Place the pumpkin wedges on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast for 45 to 50 minutes until the skin begins to shrivel and the pumpkin is fork tender. Remove from the oven and let it cool until you can tough it. Remove the pumpkin from the skin and discard any pieces on top that may be tough.
- Add it to a food processor or high-powered blender and puree until smooth. If the pumpkin seems dry, add a few tablespoons of water until it is moist and resembled the puree you see in a can. Store pumpkin in the fridge in a sealed container for about a week.
- Pancakes:
- Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium to medium-high heat.
- To a blender, add eggs, pumpkin, oats, collagen, honey, baking powder, spices, salt and milk. Blend until pureed and smooth.
- To make the pancakes, you can add coconut oil or butter to the skillet if you want that crispness. You can pour the batter directly from the blender or scoop it out into a 0.25 cup measure for more uniform pancakes. Once you pour the batter into the hot skillet, take a spoon and slightly smooth it out into a larger circle if it seems thick. Add a sprinkling of dark chocolate chunks into the batter if you wish.
- Cook the pancakes until bubbles form and the batter becomes more opaque, about 2 to 3 minutes - then flip and cook once more for 2 to 3 minutes. You'll want to cook the opposite side a bit longer than you would traditional pancakes- these are more dense.
- Serve with syrup and a sprinkle of almonds & maybe more chocolate. This will make about 8 pancakes.
