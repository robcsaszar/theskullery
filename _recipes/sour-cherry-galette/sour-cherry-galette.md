servings: 1 

notes:
- This makes enough for 2 galettes, so stick one in the freezer. ;-)

ingredients:
- for the crust:
- 4| cup(s) sifted all-purpose flour
- 1| tbsp sugar
- 3| tsp salt
- 1| large egg, lightly beaten
- 1| tsp white vinegar
- 0.5| cup(s) ice cold water
- 1.5| cup(s) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- raw sugar for sprinkling
- for brushing:
- 1 egg & a few drops of water beaten together
- for the filling: 
- 2| pounds sour cherries, fresh or thawed
- 0.3333| cup(s) sugar
- 3| tbsp cornstarch
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- 2| tbsp butter, cut into pieces
- vanilla ice cream, for serving

directions:
- Crust:
- Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse just until combined. In a small bowl, whisk mix together the egg, vinegar and water. Add the cold butter pieces into the food processor and pulse until small coarse crumbs remain. Sprinkle the water/egg mixture over the flour and pulse again until the dough comes together.
- Remove the dough with your hands and wrap it in plastic wrap. This dough makes enough for 2 galette crusts, so separate it into 2 sections now, – or separate it after it’s refrigerated.
- Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes. Freeze one of the other balls of dough.
- After 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 200°C.
- Filling:
- Place the cherries in a bowl. Toss with the sugar, cornstarch and salt, making sure to coat all the cherries. Drizzle in the vanilla extract and toss.
- Remove one of the crusts from the fridge. (The other is good for another week or so, or it can be frozen.) Roll one of the pie crusts into a… “rustic” shape – no shape necessary really – until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Place the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Places the cherries in the center leaving a 2-inch+ border of crust. Top with the butter cubes.
- Once the cherries are placed, fold the crust over top of them. Brush the crust with the beaten egg wash. Sprinkle it with the raw sugar. Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 40 to 45 minutes.
- Remove it and let cool slightly, then slice. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
