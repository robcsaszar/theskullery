ingredients:
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) ripe tomatoes, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch dice (about 3 cups) *see note*
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 large white onion, finely diced (about 3/4 cup)
- 1 to 2 serrano or jalapeÃ±o chilies, finely diced *seeds and membranes removed for a milder salsa*
- 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) lime juice from 1 lime

directions:
- Season tomatoes with 1 teaspoon (4g) salt and toss to combine. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer or colander set in a bowl and allow to drain for 20 to 30 minutes. Discard liquid.
- Combine drained tomatoes with onion, chilies, cilantro, and lime juice. Toss to combine and season to taste with salt. Pico de gallo can be stored for up to 3 days in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
notes: 
- Use the ripest tomatoes you can find. In the off season, this generally means smaller plum, Roma, or cherry tomatoes.

"Pico de gallo" translates to "rooster beak," but what it refers to is the classic Mexican condiment made from fresh tomatoes, raw onion, chopped chilies, herbal cilantro, and vibrant lime juice. ðŸ”ª
