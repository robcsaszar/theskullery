- 1.5| tsp baking powder
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.5| cup(s) coconut oil, melted
- 0.33| cup(s) granulated sugar
- 0.75| cup(s) plain greek yogurt
- 2| large eggs
- 2| tsp vanilla bean extract
- 0.25| cup(s) buttermilk
- for the Greek yoghurt glaze:
- 0.66| cup(s) plain greek yoghurt
- 1.5| cup(s) powdered sugar
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- 1| tbsp milk
- for the strawberry granola:
- 1.5| tbsp coconut oil
- 0.75| cups old-fashioned oats
- 0.25| cup(s) sliced almonds
- 3| tbsp honey
- 1| tbsp brown sugar
- pinch of salt
- pinch of cinnamon
- 0.25| cup(s) freeze-dried strawberries

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170°C. Spray your donut pan with nonstick spray.
- In a bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder and salt.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut oil and sugar until combined. Stir in the yogurt. Add in the dry ingredients and the eggs, mixing until the batter is just combined. Whisk in the vanilla paste, then stir in the buttermilk until the batter is smooth. Use a spoon and add the batter to the donut pan until each mold is about 3/4 of the way full. Bake the donuts for 13 to 15 minutes, until they are set and slightly golden. Remove and let cool. Once they are cool, dip each donut in the glaze and cover in granola. Serve immediately.
- Greek Yogurt Glaze:
- In a large bowl, whisk the yogurt and sugar until combined. Stir in the vanilla extract and milk, whisking until the glaze is smooth. If it’s too thin, add more sugar 1 tbsp at a time. If it’s too thick, add more milk 1 tsp at time. Whisk until smooth!
- Strawberry Granola:
- Melt the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the oats and almonds. Cook, stirring often, until the oats are toasty and slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the honey, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon until combined. Cook, stirring constantly, as the mixture toasts and comes together. Stir in the strawberries. Spread the granola out on a sheet of parchment and let it cool completely before breaking it clumps.
