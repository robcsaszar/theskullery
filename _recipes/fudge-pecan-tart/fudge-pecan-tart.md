servings: 1 

ingredients:
- for the crust:
- 0.5 cup(s) unsalted butter, softened
- 0.3333| cup(s) brown sugar
- 1.25 cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 0.5| tsp salt
- for the filling:
- 2| large eggs, lightly beaten
- 0.6666| cup(s) light corn syrup
- 0.25| cup(s) brown sugar
- 2| tbsp bourbon
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- 6| oz high-quality dark chocolate, chopped
- 1.5| cup(s) pecans, chopped
- 1| cup(s) unsalted whole pecans, for topping

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 175Â°C. Spray a 10-inch tart pan with nonstick spray.
- In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter, brown sugar, flour and salt together, starting on low speed and increasing to medium. The mixture will be in coarse crumbs and almost crumbly and dough like. Press it evenly into the bottom of the greased pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until slightly browned. Let it cool for about 10 to 15 minutes.
- To make the filling, whisk together the eggs, syrup and sugar until smooth. Whisk in the bourbon and vanilla extract. Use a spatula to fold in the chocolate and chopped pecans. Pour the filling on top of the crust. Top with the whole pecans.
- Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the center is set. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving. You can make this a day or two ahead of time and store it in the fridge.
