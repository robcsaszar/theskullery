time: under 60min # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 16

notes:
- Use a mortar and pestle to crush the garlic and chilies to tame the aliums if you prefer a "traditional" approach or if you don't like the taste of freshly minced garlic. Add the rest to the pre-mixture right before serving. They need as much time as possible to get married before fish sauce starts changing their chemistry.
- You can use a Daikon radish, matchstick-cut, as well.
- Since I didn't have any fresh chili on-hand, I used some dried peperoncino flakes. Worked out great!

ingredients:
- 0.5| cup hot water
- 0.5| cup white sugar
- 0.5| cup freshly squeezed lime juice
- 0.33| cup Vietnamese fish sauce
- 2| medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1| carrot, matchstick-cut *see note*
- 1| tbsp thinly sliced red chili *see note*

directions:
- Combine water, light brown sugar, fresh lime juice, vinegar, and fish sauce in a small bowl, and stir until sugar dissolves.
- Stir in matchstick-cut carrots/radish and chili.
- Top on tacos, steamed buns, or even burgers.
