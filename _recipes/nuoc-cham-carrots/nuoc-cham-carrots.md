notes: 
- You can also use apple cider vinegar for a bit more flavor.
- Since I didn't have any fresh chili on-hand, I used some dried peperoncino flakes. Worked out great!

ingredients:
- 0.25| cup water
- 5| tsp light brown sugar
- 4| tsp fresh lime juice
- 1| tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *see note*
- 1| carrot, matchstick-cut
- 1| tbsp thinly sliced red chili *see note*

directions:
- Combine water, light brown sugar, fresh lime juice, vinegar, and fish sauce in a small bowl, and stir until sugar dissolves.
- Stir in matchstick-cut carrots and chili.
- Top on tacos, steamed buns, or even burgers.
