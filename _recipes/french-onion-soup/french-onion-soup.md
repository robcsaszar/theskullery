notes:
- Caramelizing the onions slowly in butter until they're rich golden-brown (but not so dark as to taste bitter) produces the sweetest, most flavorful results.
- The homemade or store-bought chicken stock used here is typically better-quality than the store-bought beef stock many recipes call for.
- Asian fish sauce, cider vinegar, and sherry add depth and complexity to the broth.
- Yellow onions are your best all-purpose bet for this soup, but a mix of yellow, sweet (e.g., Vidalia), and red onions, as well as shallots, produces an even more complex flavor.

ingredients:
- 90|g unsalted butter, plus more for toasts
- 3| pounds yellow or mixed onions, french cut *see note*
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 120|ml dry sherry *such as Amontillado*
- 2| pounds homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
- 2| sprigs thyme
- 1| bay leaf
- 5|ml Asian fish sauce *optional*
- 5|ml cider vinegar
- 8| bowl-size slices rustic bread, toasted until crisp
- 1| medium clove garlic
- 450|g Gruy√®re cheese, grated
- freshly minced chives, for garnish

directions:
- In a large stainless steel saucepan, or in 2 large stainless steel or cast iron skillets, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, 1 to 2 hours. If browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking. Season with salt and pepper.
- Add sherry and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. (If using 2 skillets, divide sherry between them, then scrape onions and liquid from both pans into a pot or Dutch oven to continue.) Cook until alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes. Add stock, thyme, and bay leaf; raise heat to medium-high; and bring to a simmer. Lower heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Add fish sauce, if using, and cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.
- Preheat broiler and adjust oven rack to top position. Butter toasts and rub with garlic clove until fragrant. Spoon a small amount of broth into the bottoms of 4 ovenproof serving bowls, then top with half the toasts. Sprinkle some grated cheese on top of toasts, then spoon more soup and onions on top, nearly filling bowls. Set remaining 4 toasts in bowls, pushing to nearly submerge them. Top with remaining grated cheese and set bowls on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots. Garnish with chives and serve.
