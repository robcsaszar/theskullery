- for the quick-pickled cucumbers:
- 1| tsp kosher salt
- 1| tbsp sugar

- 1|tbsp dry yeast
- 580|g bread flour
- 6| tbsp sugar
- 3| tbsp nonfat dry milk powder
- 1| tbsp kosher salt
- 0.5| tsp baking powder, rounded
- 0.5| tsp baking soda
- 80|g rendered pork fat, bacon fat or vegetable shortening *room temperature*
- vegetable oil
- 340|g hoisin sauce
- thinly sliced scallions *green and white parts*
- Sriracha *for serving*

directions:
- Steamed Buns:
- Stir together the yeast and 350g room temperature water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. 
- Add the flour, sugar, milk powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda and fat and mix on the lowest speed setting for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should gather together into a ball on the hook. - Lightly oil a large bowl and put the dough in it, turning it over to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel and put it in a warm place and let the dough rise until it doubles in size, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
- Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a clean work surface. 
- Using a sharp knife, divide the dough in half, then divide each half into 5 equal pieces. Gently roll the pieces into logs, then cut each log into 5 pieces, making 50 pieces total. They should be about the size of a Ping-Pong ball and weigh about 25 grams each. Roll each piece into a ball and set them on baking sheets. Cover them loosely with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30 minutes. While they're rising, cut out fifty 4-inch squares of parchment paper.
- After 30 minutes, use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a 4-inch-long oval. 
- Brush lightly with vegetable oil, lay a chopstick horizontally across the center of the oval and fold the oval over onto itself to form a bun. Gently pull out the chopstick, leaving the bun folded, and transfer it to a square of parchment paper. Put it back under the plastic wrap and form the rest of the buns. 
- Let the buns rest for 30 to 45 minutes -- they will rise a little.
- Set up a steamer on top of the stove. Working in batches so you donâ€™t crowd the steamer, steam the buns on the parchment squares for 10 minutes. 
- You can use the buns immediately or allow them to cool completely, then put them in plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to 2 months. 
- Reheat frozen buns in a stove top steamer for 2 to 3 minutes, until puffy, soft, and warmed all the way through. Freeze half the buns in airtight bags for another time.
- Quick-Pickled Cucumbers:
- Combine the cucumbers with the sugar and salt in a small mixing bowl and toss to coat. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Use right away or refrigerate for up to 4 hours.
- Pork Belly:
- Heat the oven to 230ÂºC.
- Put the pork belly in a roasting pan that holds it snugly, fat side up. Combine 110g salt and 110g sugar in a small bowl and rub all over the pork. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, and no longer than 24.
- Discard any liquid that has accumulated in the roasting pan and put the pork belly in the oven. Cook for 1 hour, basting it with the rendered fat halfway through, until it's golden brown.
- Turn the oven temperature down to 120ÂºC and cook until the pork is tender, another 1 hour and 15 minutes or so. Transfer the pork to a plate, decant the fat and the meat juices from the pan and reserve it for the buns. Allow the pork to cool slightly.
- When itâ€™s cool enough to handle, wrap the pork in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and put it in the fridge until itâ€™s thoroughly chilled and firm. *you can skip this step if youâ€™re pressed for time, but the only way to get neat, nice-looking slices is to chill the belly thoroughly before slicing it*
- When you're ready to assemble the buns, cut the pork belly into 12mm-slices and just big enough to fit your buns. Warm them in a pan over medium heat for a minute or two, until soft and heated through.
- Open a warm bun and spread about 2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce on the inside. Add 2 pieces of pork belly, then a couple slices of pickle. Add a scattering of scallion and a squirt of Sriracha if you like. Repeat with the remaining buns, and eat!
