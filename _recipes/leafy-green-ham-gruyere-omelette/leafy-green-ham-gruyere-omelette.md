time: under 60mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsps butter or olive oil
- for the egg mixture:
- 4| large eggs
- pinch of garlic salt
- pinch of Tajín, or other chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix
- pinch of black pepper
- pinch of nutmeg *optional*
- 2| tbsps half and half *optional*
- for the fillings:
- 1| heaping handful of spinach, kale or other leafy green superfood (not frozen or canned)
- 3| thin slices of ham, cut up into small squares
- 6| thin slices of Gruyère, about 8.5 cm (3.5 inches) wide

directions:
- In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt mixtures, pepper, nutmeg, and half and half, until even and glossy.
- Place half the butter or olive oil on a shallow 10-inch (25-cm) cast iron skillet on medium heat, or a similarly sized nonstick omelet pan or skillet. Tilt and move the pan to coat evenly.
- Add ham and sauté until deep brown. Add greens, and toss for 30 seconds, or until slightly wilted, but still crunchy.
- Set aside the ham and greens.
- Add the remaining half of the butter or olive oil to the pan and stir contents thoroughly to coat evenly. Lower the heat.
- Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, tilting and moving to ensure a flat layer of eggs. Heat until the eggs have become light and fluffy on top.
- Add ham and greens back into the pan, coating the top of the eggs evenly.
- Place the cheese on the omelette.
- Gently push the edges of the omelette toward the center of the skillet with two spatulas, making sure not to break it. Turn the heat off.
- Gently scrape and lift half the omelette off the pan and fold onto the other half with the spatulas. Carefully lift the whole folded omelette onto plate and serve.
