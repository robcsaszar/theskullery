ingredients:
- for the cheese balls:
- 450|g cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1| cup(s) finely grated pecorino cheese
- 0.25| cup(s) finely chopped macadamia nuts
- 2| tbsp freshly chopped chives
- 2| tbsp chopped crispy sage *recipe below*
- 3| tsp freshly grated orange zest
- 0.5| tsp ground allspice
- 0.5| tsp freshly ground nutmeg
- pinch of salt
- pinch of freshly cracked black pepper
- for the coating:
- 0.6666| cup(s) finely chopped macadamia nuts
- 0.5| cup(s) finely chopped pecans
- 3| tbsp chopped fresh herbs, like parsley, sage and chives

directions:
- To make the crispy sage, heat 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a skillet. Once melted and bubbling, add 8 to 10 sage leaves into the butter, cooking for 2 to 2 minutes. Remove the sage with kitchen tongs and place it on a paper towel to drain any excess grease.
- In a large bowl, stir together the cream cheese, pecorino, nuts, chives, sage, orange zest, allspice, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Stir until combined and everything is evenly distributed. Taste with a cracker and determine if you would like more spice or orange. I love it just like this!
- Place a large piece of plastic wrap on your counter. Form the cheese mixture into somewhat of a ball and place it in the center of the plastic wrap. Wrap it up, forming it more into a ball as your go. Refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or even overnight. After refrigerating, you can form it into more of a ball with your hands while itâ€™s still wrapped in plastic.
- To roll the cheeseball, combine the macadamia nuts, pecans and herbs on a plate, stirring them together. Place the cheeseball on the plate and roll it through, coating the outside.
- You can serve the cheeseball immediately or wrap it up and serve a few hours later. You can make this a day or two ahead of time, but I would wait to roll the ball in the nuts, as they will soften over time because of the cream cheese.
