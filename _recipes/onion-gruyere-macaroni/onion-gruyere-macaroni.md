servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 6| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| sweet onion, thinly sliced
- kosher salt
- 8| oz whole wheat elbow noodles
- 0.25| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 2.5| cup(s) whole milk
- 6| oz gruyere cheese, freshly grated
- 4| oz swiss cheese, freshly grated
- 2| oz parmesan cheese, freshly grated
- 1| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp freshly ground nutmeg
- 2| tsp Dijon mustard
- 0.5| cup(s) panko breadcrumbs

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease an baking dish.
- In a large skillet, melt 2 tbsp of the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden and caramely, about 40 minutes.
- Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the directions, reducing the cook time by 1 minute. Drain and set aside.
- In a large pot, melt the remaining 4 tbsp butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour, whisking until combined to create a roux. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until it’s golden and fragrant. 
- Slowly pour in half the milk, whisking constantly so they mixture can thicken, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour in the other half of the milk and whisk until thickened. Reduce the heat to low and add the gruyere and swiss and all but 2 tbsp of the parmesan. 
- Stir with a large wooden spoon until the cheese melts. Stir in the paprika, cayenne, nutmeg, mustard and any salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the cooked pasta and the onions.
- Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with the panko crumbs and remaining parmesan. Bake until the top is golden and crunchy, about 25 minutes. Cook for a few minutes before serving.
