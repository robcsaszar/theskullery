notes:
- Please note that Tonka beans are not illegal to purchase but I believe it is illegal for restaurants to use them in food. Apparently when ingested in large quantities, they can be toxic. before using them, I suggest doing your own research. I felt comfortable enough to purchase a few and only used them to infuse the alcohol and for topping up my coffee.

directions:
- Cherry & Vanilla Bitter:
- In the first jar, add the dried cherries and bourbon. Shake well.
- In the second jar, add the tonka beans, cardamom pods, scraped vanilla beans and pods, star anise and bourbon. Shake well.
- In the third jar, add the gentian root, cassia chips, wild cherry bark and rye whiskey. Shake well.
- Store all jars in a cool dark place. Shake the jars once per day.
- After 5 days, strain third jar, removing all the herbs and anything that has settled on the bottom. Place the bitters back in the jar (cleaned or at least free of any bitter “sediment”) until ready to use. After 10 days, strain the first two jars, and combine them together into one jar. Allow the mixture to sit for 3 days.
- Now it’s time to combine your bitters! I found that I needed to strain mine again, so do that if needed. You want them as clear as possible. 
- There is no set “recipe” here – simply combine a few ounces of the cherry vanilla liquid and a few ounces of the bittering liquid until it reaches a bitterness you are content with. One you find it, use a mini funnel (I actually use parchment paper rolled into a funnel) and add the bitters to a jar with a dropper. 
- Let them sit for another week before use, straining once again if needed before use. I found that the final strain got them super clear.
- Chocolate Bitter:
- In the first jar, add the cocoa nibs and 101-proof bourbon. Shake well.
- In the second jar, add the tonka beans, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, vanilla beans and 101-proof bourbon.
- In the third jar, add the gentian root, saspararilla, wild cherry bark, cassia chips, black walnut leaf and 100-proof rye whiskey.
- Store all jars in a cool dark place. Shake the jars once per day.
- After 5 days, strain the third jar, removing all the herbs and anything that has settled on the bottom. Place the bitters back in the jar (cleaned or at least free of any bitter “sediment”) until ready to use. After 10 days, strain the first two jars, and combine them together into one jar. Allow the mixture to sit for 3 days.
- After 3 days, strain your jars again add 1/4 cup(s) simple syrup to the chocolate-flavored jar. 
- Combine a few ounces of the chocolate liquid and a few ounces of the bittering liquid until it reaches a bitterness you are content with. Once you find it, use a mini funnel and add the bitters to a jar with a dropper. 
- Let them sit for another week before use, straining once again if needed before use. I found that the final strain got them super clear.
- Grapefruit Bitter:
- In the first jar, add the grapefruit rind 100-proof vodka. Shake well.
- In the second jar, add the lavender, juniper berries, black walnut leaf, gentian root, tonka bean, ginger and 100-proof vodka. Shake well.
- Store all jars in a cool dark place. Shake the jars once per day.
- After 5 days, strain the second jar, removing all the herbs and anything that has settled on the bottom. Place the bitters back in the jar (cleaned or at least free of any bitter “sediment”) until ready to use. After 10 days, strain the first jar. Allow the mixture to sit for 3 days.

- Let them sit for another week before use, straining once again if needed before use. I found that the final strain got them super clear.
- Strawberry Ginger Bitter:
- Combine all ingredients together in one jar and let them sit for 10 days. Store the jar in cool, dark place and shake it once per day.
- After 10 days, strain the jar to remove the ingredients and sediment from the bottom. 
- Let the mixture sit for another 3 days and strain again. Add the mixture to dropper jars, straining one more time in another day or two to remove any bits from the bottom.
