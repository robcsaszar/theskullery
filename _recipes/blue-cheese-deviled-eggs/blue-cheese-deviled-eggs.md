time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 18 

ingredients:
- 2| heads garlic
- 18| large eggs
- 10| slices bacon, thick-cut
- 10| asparagus spears, woody stems removed
- 1| pinch each of salt, pepper, and garlic powder
- 0.5| cup(s) mayonnaise
- 0.25| cup(s) plain greek yogurt, full fat
- 1.5| tbsp Dijon mustard
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 2| oz blue cheese, crumbled
- 0.5| tsp smoked paprika
- 2| tbsp fresh chives

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 175°C. Slice the top off the heads of garlic and drizzle them with olive oil. Wrap them tightly in aluminum foil and place it in the oven to roast for 45 to 60 minutes. You want the cloves to be caramely and golden. Remove the garlic and unwrap it, allowing it to cool until you can touch it. You can do this a day or two ahead of time if you’d like.
- To boil the perfect egg, place the eggs in a large pot and fill it with cold water. Bring it to a boil and let bubble for 1 minute, then turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let the pot sit for 15 minutes. 
- After 15 minutes, place the pot in the sink and fill it with cold water to cool the eggs down immediately. You want the eggs to sit in cold water for 30 minutes or so, so you will need to dump the water and refill with cold water a few times. You can add some ice cubes too!
- While the eggs are cooling, heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until crisp and all the fat is rendered. Place the bacon on a paper towel to drain the grease. Keep 1 to 2 tbsp of the grease in the skillet (reserve the rest!) and throw the asparagus in the skillet. Sprinkle it with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cook for 5 minutes, just until slightly softened. Turn off the heat.
- After 30 minutes, peel the eggs and place them on a paper towel. Slice off a TINY piece of the fat bottom of the egg so it can “stand up.” Slice off the upper 0.5 of the egg to reveal the yolk (occasionally you might have to slice off more or less, it just depends). Gently scoop the yolk out of each egg with a small spoon, fork or knife, trying not to destroy the white in the process. This can be difficult, so do it patiently and gently. *or you can just cut the eggs halfway lengthwise if it proves to difficult*
- Add the bacon slices to a food processor and pulse until it is in crumbles. It may stick together and be paste-like, which is fine because it will stick to the eggs better! Remove the bacon and place it in a bowl. 
- Do NOT clean out the food processor, and add the egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, mustard, salt, pepper, and roasted garlic cloves (squeeze them out of the bulb) to the food processor. Add in a drizzle of reserved bacon grease if you have it, like 1 to 2 teaspoons. 
- Blend until smooth and creamy and mousse-like. Scoop out the mixture and spoon it (or pipe it with a pastry bag) into the open egg whites. 
- Top the yolk mixture with a sprinkle of the crumbled bacon, pressing it gently to adhere. 
- Add some blue cheese crumbs. Slice the asparagus in half if needed (you’ll need to cut it to get 18 pieces and I recommend doing it AFTER cooking) and stick it down in the eggs. 
- Sprinkle on smoked paprika, and chives and go to town.
