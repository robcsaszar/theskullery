- for a quick guacamole:

directions:
- Place the chicken in a dish or resealable plastic bag and cover it with the salt, pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder and cumin. Add in the lime juice. Marinate for 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 170°C.
- Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Add the chicken and sear it on both sides until it’s deeply golden brown. Pour in the beer and let it cook down almost halfway.
- Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the skillet and using forks or kitchen tongs, shred the chicken and toss with any of the juices and beer in the skillet.
- To assemble the sliders, add the guacamole on the bottom of the bun, top with the chicken and then add on the corn pico de gallo. 
- Quick Guacamole:
- Mash the avocado in a bowl. One mashed, stir in the pepper, onion, cilantro and lime juice. Add in the salt and pepper and mash. Taste and season additionally if needed.
- Grilled Corn Pico de Gallo:
- Combine all the ingredients together in a large bowl and stir. Let sit for 30 minutes or so for the flavor to develop.
