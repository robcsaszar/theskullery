servings: 1 

ingredients:
- for the strawberries:
- 3| cup(s) chopped & halved strawberries
- 0.3333| cup(s) sugar
- 1| tbsp cornstarch
- for the topping:
- 1.3333| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 2| tbsp sugar
- 2| tsp baking powder
- 0.25| tsp cinnamon
- pinch of salt
- 6| tbsp unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces
- 1| egg, lightly beaten
- 0.5| cup(s) milk
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- vanilla ice cream for serving

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170°C. Spray a baking dish with nonstick spray. Add the strawberries and sprinkle with the sugar and cornstarch. Toss gently, just until the berries are coated.
- To make the cobbler topping, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Using a fork, pastry blender or your fingers, add the butter and incorporate it into the flour until small pieces and crumbs remain. Beat together the egg, milk and vanilla extract. Add it into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms. Add spoonfuls of the dough all over the strawberries.
- Bake the cobbler for 35 to 45 minutes, until it’s golden and cooked through. I sometimes pull it out and check the underside of the cobbler, just to make sure the topping it cooked through.
- Serve immediately with vanilla ice cream.
