ingredients:
- 1| cup(s) pulled pork
- 4| ripe avocados
- 1| jalapeño pepper, seeded and diced
- 0.3333| cup(s) crumbled queso fresco cheese plus extra for topping
- 0.25| cup(s) chopped fresh cilantro
- 3| tbsp diced sweet onion
- 1| lime, juiced
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 1| jalapeño pepper, sliced for topping

directions:
- You can easily make the pork ahead of time or use leftover pulled pork, which is what I'd suggest for this recipe. Before serving the pork, I like to crisp it up in the oven. To do this, I spread the shredded pork in a large baking dish. Preheat the oven to 220°C. 
- Place the baking dish in the oven and roast for 20- 30 minutes, tossing the pork with a fork every 10 minutes. You don’t HAVE to do this step, but it really makes it taste more like authentic carnitas.
- Place the avocados, the cheese, cilantro, onion, lime juice, salt and pepper to a bowl and mash it! Mash and stir until everything is combined. Make it as smooth or as chunky as you’d like. 
- Taste and season with additional salt, pepper or lime juice if needed. Top with the pork, a sprinkle of extra cheese and cilantro and a few sliced peppers.
