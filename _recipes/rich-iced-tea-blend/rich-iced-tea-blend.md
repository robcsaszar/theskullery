- 0.5| single citrus fruit *optional*
- 0.5| cup ice *optional*

directions:
- Place tea bags in a 1-L coffeepot or French press. Make sure to keep the strings tense to prevent the paper weights from falling in.
- Boil the water. Pour into the coffeepot or French press. Place lid on top, with a tight grip on the paper weights.
- Let the tea steep for 5 minutes.
- If you are using a French press, slowly push the plunger onto the bags, again with a tight grip on the paper weights.
- Take off the lid, scoop the teabags out and gently squeeze the brew from the bags before disposing of them.
- Add sugar and stir thoroughly.
- Let tea cool to room temperature. If you want the tea sooner, place open pot in freezer for 70 minutes.
- Serve with ice. For a good milk tea simulacrum, add maple syrup and dairy/dairy substitute. Otherwise, add citrus juice if you like.
