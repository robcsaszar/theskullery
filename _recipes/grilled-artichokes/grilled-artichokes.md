time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 4

ingredients:
  - 4| large artichokes
  - 0.25| cup balsamic vinegar
  - 0.25| cup water
  - 0.25| cup soy sauce
  - 0.25| cup olive oil
  - 1| tbsp garlic *minced*

directions:
  - Slice artichoke tops off, crosswise. Trim the stems.
  - Boil or steam the artichokes until bottoms pierce easily, or a petal pulls off with ease.
  - Drain and cool the artichokes, then cut each artichoke in half lengthwise. Scrape out the fuzzy center and any purple-tipped petals.
  - Mix remaining ingredients in a large plastic bag, then place artichokes in the bag and coat all sides of the artichokes.
  - Leave to marinate for at least one hour -- for best flavor leave it overnight in the refridgerator.
  - Drain, and place the artichokes cut-side down on a hot grill.
  - Cook until lightly browned on the cut site, 5 to 7 minutes, then turn them over and drizzle some of the remaining marinade.
  - Grill until petal tips are lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes more.
  - Serve hot or at room temperature.
