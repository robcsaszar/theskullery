directions:
- Place the tuna in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oil, vinegar, sesame seeds, ginger and garlic. Pour over the tuna and toss to coat. Stir in the green onion. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes.
- Right before serving, stir in the cubed avocado and the pineapple.
- To make the bowls, place rice in the bowl. Cover with a handful of cucumbers *I like to toss mine in toasted sesame oil*, seaweed salad, extra sliced avocado, and a big scoop of the tuna and marinade. Top with extra sesame seeds. This is wonderful eaten with tortilla chips!
