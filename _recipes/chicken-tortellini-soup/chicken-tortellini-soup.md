ingredients:
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| small sweet onion diced
- 0.5| cup(s) chopped carrots
- 0.5| cup(s) chopped celery
- 2| garlic cloves minced
- 0.5| tsp oregano
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp pepper
- 1.5| cup(s) cooked shredded chicken
- 5| cup(s) low-sodium chicken stock
- 1| package of your favorite tortellini *dry or fresh
- 1| cup(s) milk or half-and-half
- 1.5| tbsp flour
- fresh oregano and thyme for garnish

directions:
- Heat a large pot over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. Once the butter melts, add in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. 
- Stir and cook until the veggies soften, about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken and cook for a minute or two. 
- Add in the chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer. Add in the tortellini and cook it for 5 minutes.
- While the tortellini is cooking, fill a shaker cup(s) with the milk. Add the flour to the milk and shake the cup(s) for at least 30 seconds. After 5 minutes, stream in the milk slurry while stirring. Bring the soup back to a simmer and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes as it thickens.
- Taste it and season more with salt and pepper if you find it necessary. Sprinkle with fresh oregano and thyme and serve.
