servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 4| honeycrisp apples
- 0.5| tsp cinnamon
- 2| cups water
- 1| cup(s) old-fashioned rolled outs
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.25| cup(s) heavy cream
- 0.25| cup(s) dark brown sugar
- 0.5| cup(s) hazelnuts toasted and chopped
- for the Maple Brown Butter
- 4| tbsp unsalted butter
- 4| tbsp maple syrup

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Spray a baking dish with nonstick spray. (To peel the hazelnuts, bring water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Boil for 3 minutes, then drain and run under cold water to remove the skins.)
- Take each apple and cut the stem and center out to create a hole in the middle. You want to be able to stuff the oatmeal in the center and you also want to use the apple insides for the oatmeal! Chop up the apple that you remove from center. Sprinkle the apple insides with the cinnamon.
- Bring the water to boil. Add the oats, apple pieces and the salt and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until the oats are thick and creamy, about 10  to 15 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and brown sugar.
- While the oatmeal is cooking, heat the hazelnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat, shaking or stirring constantly. Cook until they are toasted and fragrant, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove, let cool and then coarsely chop.
- Drizzle each apple inside with some the maple brown butter (but save some for the topping too!). Fill each apple with the oatmeal and top with the hazelnuts. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until - the apples are softened.
- Serve immediately with the remaining maple brown butter. And you can always add ice cream on top if desired!
- Maple Brown Butter:
- Heat the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, whisking constantly. Cook until it bubbles and the brown bits appear on the bottom (about 4 to 5 minutes) then quickly stir in the maple syrup and remove it from the heat. Whisk for another 30 seconds. Use immediately.
