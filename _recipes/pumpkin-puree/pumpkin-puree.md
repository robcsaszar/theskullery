notes:
- Store homemade pumpkin puree in food-safe containers in the fridge for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months.
- Homemade puree tends to be a little more watery than the canned stuff, especially if defrosted, so you may need to reduce any additional liquid in a recipe by 2-3 tablespoons – just be aware of that if it’s too runny!

ingredients:
- 1| small baking pumpkin
- fine sea salt, optional

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200°C.
- Slice the pumpkin in half.
- Scoop out the seeds of the pumpkin.
- Lightly season the inside of the pumpkin halves with salt then place cut-side-down onto the baking sheet. 
- Roast for 40-60 minutes.
- Remove from oven and allow to cool enough to handle. When cool, carefully scrape flesh from skin. Discard the skin.
- Blend with a food processor, kitchen, or immersion blender until smooth.
