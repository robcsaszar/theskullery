servings: 1 

notes:
- To make the strained pineapple puree, I pureed about 2 cups pineapple cubes in a blender until smooth, then poured the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. 

ingredients:
- for the pineapple curd:
- 0.75| cup(s) strained pineapple puree *see note*
- 1| cup(s) sugar
- 3| tbsp cornstarch
- pinch of salt
- 5| large egg yolks
- 6| tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature
- for the pavlova:
- 5| large egg whites
- 1| cup sugar
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- 2| tsp cornstarch
- for topping:
- whipped cream or coconut whipped cream
- kiwi

directions:
- Pineapple Curd:
- In a saucepan, whisk together the pineapple puree, sugar and cornstarch. 
- Heat over medium-low heat, whisking, until the sugar dissolves. 
- Place the egg yolks in a bowl. Whisk in a few tbsp of the warm pineapple mixture, then reduce the heat and add the eggs to the saucepan, whisking the entire time. Cook over low heat until it thickens, stirring constantly, for about 10 minutes.
- Once thick, remove from heat and stir in the butter until it melts. Pour the curd into a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap directly on top. Let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for 4 hours.
- Pavlova:
- Preheat the oven to 150°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Add the egg whites to the bowl of your electric mixer. Beat on medium-high until they just start to get thick, then gradually add in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until the mixture is glossy and peaks are easily held. Carefully fold in the vanilla extract and cornstarch with a rubber spatula.
- Spoon the meringue onto the parchment, using the spatula to form it into a large circle. You can also make a few mini pavlovas instead of 1 large if you’d like. 
- Try to create a small indentation in the center or leave it flat for topping. 
- Bake for 1 hour – the outside should be firm and just starting to crack.
- Remove the sheet and set it on a wire rack until completely cool. 
- To serve the pavlova, top it with whipped cream, the pineapple curd (you might not use ALL of it, it’s up to you. it will stay good in the fridge for a week or so!), kiwi and extra whipped cream. 
- Cut into slices (it will be messy) and plate!
