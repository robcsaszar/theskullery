ingredients:
- for the jäger sauce:
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 1| cup(s) onion, chopped *or shallots*
- 8| oz mushrooms, sliced *I'd go for wild mushrooms, but anything works*
- 0.5| cup(s) vegetable or beef broth
- 0.5| cup(s) white wine
- 0.5| cup(s), plus 2 tbsp half-and-half or cream, divided
- 2| tbsp all-purpose flour
- 3| tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 0.25| tsp salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- for the schnitzel:
- 1| pound pork cutlets
- 3| tbsp all-purpose flour
- 0.25| tsp salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 0.25| tsp cayenne pepper
- 2| tbsp unsalted butter
- 0.5| cup(s) Butterkäse, shredded
- for the spätzle:
- 1 cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 0.25| cup(s) milk
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

directions:
- Jäger Sauce:
- Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat.
- Add the shallot or onions, and sauté until translucent.
- Place the sliced mushrooms in the pan, and brown for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Pour in the broth and white wine, and cook for 3 minutes.
- Add 1/2 cup of half-and-half or cream, bring the mixture to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for several minutes.
- In a small, separate bowl, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons half-and-half or cream with 2 tablespoons of flour.
- Add the flour slurry to the mushroom mixture, and bring to a boil, stirring to avoid clumps.
- Add the fresh chopped parsley. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
- Turn off the heat, and cover the pan with aluminum foil to keep the sauce warm while the cutlets are cooking.
- Schnitzel: 
- Preheat your oven to 200°C.
- Lay the pork cutlets out on a cutting board. 
- Cover the cutlets with plastic wrap, and use a kitchen mallet or your fist to pound the cutlets until thin (1/4-inch thick or less).
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the 3 tablespoons flour, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper, and set aside.
- Melt the unsalted butter in a medium-sized oven-safe skillet. 
- Dip each cutlet into the flour mixture, and shake off the excess.
- Place in the skillet, and sauté in the butter for 3 minutes on each side or until the pork cutlets are cooked through.
- Retrieve the still warm creamy jaeger sauce, pour it over the cooked cutlets, sprinkle on the cheese and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes.
- Serve alongside the spätzle.
- Spätzle:
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Mix flour, egg, milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a medium bowl.
- Working in batches while using a sturdy spoon, force spätzle through holes of a spätzle maker or large-holed colander into the boiling water. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until noodles float to the surface. Drain well into a colander, and quickly shock spätzle with cold water.
- Heat butter and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add spätzle, shake once to distribute evenly, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
