servings: 1 

notes:
- Depending on the sweetness of your fruit, you may want to add more/less simple syrup, so I suggest tasting as you go.
- Add more if you like your drinks strong. Malibu also makes a mango rum that you could combine with traditional coconut rum.

ingredients:
- 8| fresh mint leaves
- 2.5| oz simple syrup *see note*
- 1| oz coconut rum *see more*
- 1.5| oz club soda
- 2| oz mango puree
- 1| lime, juiced

directions:
- To make the mango puree, combine peeled + chopped, ripe mango in a food processor (or high speed blender) with the juice of 1 lime, and process until smooth (or at least almost smooth).
- In the bottom of a glass, add simple syrup and the mint leaves. Muddle with a muddler or use the clean bottom of something blunt, like a screwdriver! 
- Add ice to the glass, and pour rum, syrup, mango puree, lime juice and club soda over top. 
- Mix with a long spoon or knife and serve with an additional sprig of mint.
