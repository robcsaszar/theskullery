time: over 120mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 3| cups bread flour
- 0.25| tsp instant yeast
- 1.5| tsp fine grain sea salt
- 15|g distilled white vinegar
- 85|g beer *pilsner works well*
- 198|g water
- 1| cup diced extra sharp cheddar cheese
- 0.3333| cup(s) finely chopped jalapeño (including ribs and seeds)
- for toppings: 
- 3| tablespoons shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese
- 1| tbsp sliced jalapeños

directions:
- Combine flour, yeast and salt. Pour vinegar, beer and water over the dry ingredients, then, using a fork, mix thoroughly until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 - 24 hours. The dough should double in size.
- Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle with a little extra flour. Using your hands, gently pat the dough into a rectangle. 
- Sprinkle with flour as needed if the dough is sticking. Distribute 1/2 of the diced cheddar and jalapeño over the surface of the dough. Gently fold the dough over itself like folding a letter. Turn 90 degrees, gently pat to a rectangle, distribute remaining cheddar and jalapeño, and fold again. 
- Shape the dough into a ball by pulling edges into middle. Place dough in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper, then lift and lower into a cast-iron dutch oven. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rise for 2 hours.
- Set an oven rack to the middle position. Uncover the dough, sprinkle the surface with a little flour, and using a sharp knife, make 2 slits across the top of the dough in an X shape about 1/2-inch deep. 
- Cover the pot with its lid, and place in the cold oven. Heat the oven to 210°C, and when this temperature has been reached, let cook for 30 minutes. 
- After the 30 minutes have elapsed, carefully remove the lid, sprinkle the toppings evenly over the loaf and continue to bake until the loaf is a deep brown (about 30 minutes longer). 
- Using the parchment overhang, carefully remove the bread from pot, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely (about 2 hours).
