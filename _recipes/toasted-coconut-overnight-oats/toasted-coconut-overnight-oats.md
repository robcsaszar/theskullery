time: over 120mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 1 

notes:
- To toast the coconut, I simply place a 0.5 cup or so in a dry pan and set it over low heat. I cook, stirring often, until it is golden brown and fragrant. Don’t leave it unattended – it will burn.

ingredients:
- 1| cup(s) rolled oats
- 1| can coconut milk *light or full-fat*
- 0.5| cup(s) greek yogurt, preferably coconut flavored! (I used siggi’s)
- 0.25| cup(s) toasted unsweetened, flaked coconut *see note*
- 2| tbsp honey
- 1| tbsp chia seeds
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.33| cup almond butter
- for the honey caramelized pineapple:
- 0.5| cup(s) pineapple chunks
- 1| tbsp honey
- for serving: 
- extra toasted coconut
- almond butter
- sliced kiwi
- honey for drizzling

directions:
- In a large bowl, stir together the oats, coconut milk, yogurt, toasted coconut, honey, chia seeds and vanilla extract until combined.
- In two jars, bowls or containers, layer 1 to 2 tbsp of almond butter into each and press it on the bottom of the jar. Top each with equal spoonfuls of the overnight oat mixture. Add another tbsp or so of the almond butter (basically, finish what you have) and top with the remaining oats. I like to top it with more toasted coconut then cover with plastic wrap and place in the - fridge overnight.
- When ready to serve, top the oats with the pineapple, sliced kiwi, a bit more almond butter and toasted coconut. Drizzle everything with honey and go at it!
- Honey Caramelized Pineapple:
- Add the pineapple to a skillet over medium heat and add the honey. Cook, tossing and stirring often, until the pineapple becomes golden and caramely.
