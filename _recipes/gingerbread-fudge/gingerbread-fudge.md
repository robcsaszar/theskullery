servings: 1 

notes:
- Do not use chocolate melts, this needs to be chocolate block to set properly.

ingredients:
- 50|g butter
- 395|g can of sweetened condensed milk
- 0.75| cup(s) packed soft brown sugar
- 0.25| cup(s) golden syrup
- 2| tsp ground ginger 
- 1| tsp cinnamon
- 0.5| tsp nutmeg 
- 250|g good quality white chocolate, roughly chopped *see note*

directions:
- Grease and line a 20cm square cake tin.
- Put butter, sugar, syrup and condensed milk into a saucepan and melt over low to medium heat until butter and sugar are fully melted. Keep stirring throughout until the mixture is almost boiling (it’ll bubble and pop a bit, that’s what to look for).
- Stir in the spices and chocolate until the chocolate is fully melted and it’s all mixed together. 
- Tip into the cake tin and swirl with a skewer. If you wait a couple of minutes it’ll start to stiffen up and you’ll get clearer swirls.
- Leave in the fridge for 3/4 hours until set. Cut into pieces. Store in the fridge.
