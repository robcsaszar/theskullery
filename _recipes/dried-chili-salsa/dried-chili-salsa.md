- This salsa is typically made with chiles pa칤s, which are not widely available outside of the Yucat치n. I use a combination of chiles de 치rbol and chiles pasillas in their place (I got them from eMAG). If you can find bitter oranges (Seville oranges), use 180ml fresh bitter-orange juice in place of the lime, orange, and grapefruit juice combo per serving.

ingredients:
- 30|g dried chiles de 치rbol
- 30|g dried chiles pasillas
- 60|ml fresh juice from 4 to 5 limes
- 60|ml fresh juice from 1 grapefruit
- 60|ml fresh juice from 1 orange
- salt

directions:
- Use kitchen shears to trim stems from all chilies. Discard stems. Place chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until fragrant and pliable, about 20 seconds total, adding time in 5-second increments if chilies do not smell toasted after the initial 20.
- Combine chilies, lime juice, grapefruit juice, and orange juice in the jar of a blender with a small pinch of salt. Blend at high speed until smooth. 
- Transfer to a bowl, let rest for 15 to 20 minutes, then stir in more salt to taste. Salsa can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for several weeks.
