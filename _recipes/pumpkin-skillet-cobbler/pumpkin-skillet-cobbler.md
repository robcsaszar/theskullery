notes:
- The texture of this cobbler is much like this chocolate cobbler and NOT fruit cobbler. It’s almost like a gooey pumpkin brownie or cake with a semi-crunchy cake topping.

ingredients:
- 0.5| cup(s) brown sugar
- 2| large eggs
- 1| can pumpkin puree
- 0.75| cup(s) evaporated milk
- 1.5| tsp pumpkin pie spice
- 4| tsp cinnamon
- 1.5| tsp ginger
- 0.75| tsp ground cloves
- 0.75| tsp nutmeg
- a pinch of cardamom
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- 1| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 0.6666| cup(s) sugar
- 2| tsp baking powder
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| cup(s) unsalted butter melted
- vanilla or cinnamon ice cream for serving
- chopped chocolate for topping

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170°C. Have an oven-safe skillet ready.
- Combine all spices together and mix thoroughly. Store in an airtight container.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and eggs until smooth. Stir in the pumpkin puree, milk, pie spice, salt and vanilla extract until smooth. Pour the mixture in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. This is your homemade “cake mix” topping! Sprinkle it evenly over the pumpkin mixture. Drizzle the melted butter over top.
- Bake the cobbler for 55 to 60 minutes, until the topping is slightly golden and set. Remove the skillet and let it sit and cool for at least 30 minutes – this dessert needs 30 minutes to “set”, otherwise, it will be somewhat gooey inside.
- Serve with ice cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon or pie spice and chopped chocolate.
