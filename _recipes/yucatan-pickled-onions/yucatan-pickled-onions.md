- Par-cooking the onions in water softens them while allowing you to keep the bright, fresh flavor of the citrus juice uncooked.
- Using a combination of grapefruit, lime, and orange juice replicates some of the floral, bitter aroma of Seville oranges if they are unavailable.

ingredients:
- 1| red onion(s), finely diced
- 15| whole black peppercorns
- 15| whole allspice berries
- 4| bay leaves
- 80|ml juice from 1 grapefruit *see note*
- 80|ml juice from 1 to 2 oranges *see note*
- 80|ml juice from 4 to 5 limes plus a little extra just in case *see note*
- salt

directions:
- Place onion, peppercorns, allspice, and bay leaves in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, drain carefully, and transfer onions to a sealable container, such as a Mason jar.
- Add grapefruit, orange, and lime juice. Onions should be submerged at this point; if they aren't, top off with extra lime juice. Stir to combine, season to taste with salt (they should be quite salty—use about 1 teaspoon of kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon of table salt), cover, and refrigerate until color deepens, about 2 hours. Onions can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Do not eat peppercorns, allspice berries, or bay leaves.
