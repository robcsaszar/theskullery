time: under 60mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 10 

notes:
- Start the burgers and heat the oil while the onion rings are in the fridge. This way, it makes for a fairly “quick” meal, given the components.

ingredients:
- 4| slices bacon
- 1| pound ground sirloin *best with 93% lean*
- 0.66| cup(s) panko breadcrumbs
- 1| tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1| tbsp Djion mustard
- 0.5| cup(s) smoky BBQ sauce, plus extra for serving
- 1| tbsp honey
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 4| oz pepper-jack cheese, sliced
- 8| slider buns
- for the frizzled onions:
- 1| large egg
- 1| cup(s) buttermilk or kefir
- 1| large sweet onion, sliced into super thin rings
- 1| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 1| tsp garlic powder
- 0.5| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5| tsp black pepper
- peanut oil for frying
- 1| tsp sea salt

directions:
- In a large skillet, cook the bacon until crispy and the fat is rendered. Once crispy, remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel to drain. Once cool, break it into thirds or fourths so it fits on the burgers. Pour most of the bacon fat out of the skillet, leaving just a little to cook the sliders in.
- In a large bowl, combined the beef, breadcrumbs, worcertershire, mustard, bbq sauce, honey, salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until the ingredients are dispersed and distributed. Form the mixture into 8 (depending on the serving size) equal patties.
- Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliders and cook until browned and crisp on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to low, cover the sliders with the cheese slices and cover the skillet until it melts.
- To serve, add a bit of bbq sauce on each bun. Cover with the meatloaf patty, a few pieces of bacon and the other bun top.
- Frizzled Onions:
- In a bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk. Add the sliced onion rings and cover them completely in the milk. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
- In a baking dish, whisk together the flour, garlic powder, smoked paprika  and pepper. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and fit it with a candy thermometer. Add enough peanut oil so you have a few inches to fry in. You want the temp of the oil to reach 180°C.
- Take the onion rings out of the fridge. Remove each ring and shake off the excess milk, then dredge it through the seasoned flour mixture. Add it to the oil and fry until it’s golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes, flipping once or twice. 
- Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain the excess oil. Cover with salt while still hot!
