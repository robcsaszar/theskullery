notes:
- You can also make these in little ramekins for single serving portions.

ingredients:
- 2| slices bacon, diced
- 0.5| sweet onion, diced
- 2| garlic cloves, minced
- 1| tbsp tomato paste, I really love this basil one!
- 0.3333| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.25| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 0.25| tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 2.5| cups spicy tomato sauce
- 1 jar of roasted red peppers, drained
- 6| large eggs
- 0.5| cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- fresh herbs for topping, basil, rosemary, thyme
- doughy bread for serving

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
- Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat and add the bacon. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Once some of the fat as rendered, stir in the onion and cook until it softens, about 5 to 6 minutes, and the bacon is crispy. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste, paprika, salt, pepper and pepper flakes. Cook for another minute. Pour in the tomato sauce and stir. Bring the sauce to a simmer and turn off the heat. Stir in the roasted red peppers. Gently crack each egg into the sauce, creating a little well with a spoon.
- Bake the eggs until the whites are cooked through and the yolks just set (or to your desired doneness), about 15 or 20 minutes. Top with a bunch of fresh herbs and the grated parm. Scoop the eggs into a bowl with the sauce and serve immediately with crusty bread.
