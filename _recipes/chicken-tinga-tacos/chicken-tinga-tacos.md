- A good substitute for fresh cotija cheese is feta. A good substitute for aged cotija cheese is Parmeggiano Regiano or Pecorino Romano.
- If making this in an instant pot -- blend all sauce ingredients *no saute needed*. Add sauce to instant pot along with about a pound of chicken breasts. Cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. Shred the chicken in sauce and serve.

ingredients:
- for the sauce: # (we also have component subtitles, just add a ':') 
- 1| tablespoon(s) olive oil
- 1| cup(s) roughly chopped sweet onion
- 2| cloves garlic, minced
- 2| chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped
- 1| teaspoon(s) dried oregano
- 0.5| teaspoon ground cumin
- 0.75| cup(s) canned crushed fire-roasted tomatoes
- 0.25| cup(s) chicken stock
- 0.5| teaspoon(s) kosher salt
- 3| cups shredded cooked chicken *rotisserie chicken also perfect*
- for serving:
- 10| (6-inch) corn tortillas
- 2| ripe avocados, sliced
- 0.25| cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 0.5| cup(s) diced red onion
- crumbled cotija cheese *see note*
- 1| lime, cut into wedges

directions:
- Sauce:
- Heat a large skillet over medium. Once warm, add the oil and onion. Sauté for 4 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Stir in the chipotles, oregano, and cumin, and toast for 1 minute. Add in the tomatoes, stock, and salt. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 7 minutes.
- Place the tomato mixture in a high-powered or regular blender, and blend until smooth.
- Return the blended sauce to the pan over low heat. Add the chicken, and cook for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt or even an egg if necessary.
- Serving: 
- Prepare the garnishes. To assemble, top the tortillas with the chicken and garnish with the avocado slices, cilantro, red onion, and cotija. Serve with a lime wedge for squeezing.
