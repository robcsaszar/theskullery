- 1| cup(s) whole milk ricotta cheese
- 4| peaches sliced in half, pits removed

directions:
- Combine the lavender and honey in a saucepan over low heat. Stir and cook over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until the honey is thin and watery. Remove the honey from the heat and let it sit or 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or fine mesh sieve to remove the lavender pieces.
- Add the ricotta to a food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Blend in 1 tablespoon of the honey.
- Brush the peaches with the melted coconut oil. Heat the grill on the highest setting and add the peaches, cut side down. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes, rotating the peaches once during cooking time. *you can also char them on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet*
- Remove the peaches, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and top each with a spoonful of the ricotta, then drizzle with the honey. Sprinkle on extra dried lavender if desired. Serve immediately!
