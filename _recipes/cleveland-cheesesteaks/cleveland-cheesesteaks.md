directions:
- Pretzel Rolls:
- Combine the water, sugar, yeast, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix with the dough hook until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes.
- Add the salt and 4 1/2 cups flour to the mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and begins to pull away from the side of the bowl, about 3 to 4 minutes. If the dough appears too wet, add additional flour, 1 tbsp at a time. Remove the dough from the bowl, place on a flat surface and knead into a ball with your hands.
- Coat a large bowl with canola oil, add the dough and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size. This will take about 1 hour.
- Preheat the oven to 210°C. Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.
- Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a flat surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a hot-dog-like roll. 
- Slowly add the baking soda to the boiling water. 
- Boil the pretzels in the water solution, 2 at a time for 30 seconds, splashing the tops with the warmed water using a spoon. 
- Remove with a large flat slotted spatula or a spider. 
- Place 4 pretzels on each a parchment lined baking sheet, brush the tops with the egg wash and season liberally with sea salt. 
- Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until pretzels are golden brown.
- Remove pretzels from oven and let cool on a wire baking rack.
- Cheese Steak:
- Preheat oven to 170°C.
- Heat a dutch oven over high heat, add a little olive oil. Season the brisket with salt and pepper. 
- When the dutch oven is hot place the brisket in the pot and sear both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from heat. 
- Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, water, Worcestershire and cider vinegar. Cover and bake for 3.5-4 hours or until the meat is tender and shreds easily.
- Do not turn off the oven just yet.
- Toppings:
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Melt 1 tablespoon butter and then add the garlic. 
- Sauté 30 seconds then add the mushrooms and onions. Cook 5-8 minutes or until mushrooms are browned and onions are cooked down. 
- Remove and place on a plate.
- To the same skillet add another tablespoon butter. Add the bell peppers and cook for 5-8 minutes or until peppers start to brown and char a bit. 
- Add to the plate with the mushrooms and onions.
- Assembling: 
- Slice the Pretzel Hoagie Rolls down the center and open them up with your fingers. 
- Add a little shredded provolone and then stuff with the shredded brisket and drizzle with some of the sauce left in the pot used to cook the brisket. 
- Add a handful or so of the peppers, mushrooms and onions and then top with more cheese. 
- Wrap the sandwiches tightly in foil and place them on a baking sheet. 
- Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven and unwrap.
