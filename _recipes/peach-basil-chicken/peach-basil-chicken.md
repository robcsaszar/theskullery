ingredients:
- 1| pound bone-in chicken thighs
- 1| tsp dried basil
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.5| tsp pepper
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tbsp butter
- 2| shallots thinly, sliced
- 4| garlic cloves, minced
- 2| peaches sliced
- 0.25| cup(s) peach preserves
- 0.25| cup(s) dry white wine
- 0.25| cup(s) dry sherry
- 1| handful fresh basil leaves chopped, plus extra for garnish

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
- Season the chicken with the basil, salt and pepper. Heat an oven safe (cast iron or enamel) pot or skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the chicken and sear it on both sides until it's golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set it aside on a plate. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter.
- Add in the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt. Stir well and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the peaches. Cook for another 5 minutes. Add in the peach preserves, wine and sherry, stirring with a wooden spoon to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken back in. Place the pot in the oven for 20 minutes.
- Remove the chicken and sprinkle with the chopped basil. Serve the chicken with a spoon for the extra sauce. You can serve this with rice, potatoes, quinoa, grilled bread, or your favorite salad.
