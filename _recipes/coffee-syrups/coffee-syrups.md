notes:
- Left too long, your syrup can get moldy, so make only quantities that you’re likely to use within a reasonable time frame (1-2 weeks).

ingredients:
- for the vanilla bean syrup:
- 0.5| cup(s) sugar
- 0.33| cup(s) water
- 1| vanilla bean, seeds scraped
- 0.5| tsp pure vanilla extract
- for the blackberry syrup:
- 2| cup(s) fresh blackberries
- 0.33| cup(s) water
- 0.33| cup(s) sugar
- for the cinnamon brown sugar syrup:
- 0.5| cup(s) brown sugar
- 0.5| tsp cinnamon
- 0.33| cup(s) water
- for the almond syrup:
- 0.5| cup(s) sugar
- 0.33| cup(s) water
- 1| tsp pure almond extract

directions:
- Cold Brew Coffee:
- First things first, coarsely grind the coffee beans! Yeah, this is annoying. I tried to make coldbrew coffee with already ground beans, and grinding them definitely is better. I used my grinder thing for my vitamix. Just make sure they are **coarsely** ground, this way you won’t have granules floating in your drink. 
- Once the beans a freshly ground, add them to a large bowl or pitcher/container/jar. Add the water and stir to mix. Let this mixture sit overnight in the fridge.
- The next morning, strain the coffee through a few layers of cheesecloth or a coffee filter. It’s key to reduce the granules. 
- Fill a glass with ice, add your desired amount of coffee and cream/milk – then go to town with the syrups.
- Vanilla Bean Syrup:
- Combine the sugar, water, scraped vanilla beans, whole bean and extract in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
- Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in a jar. I usually don’t remove the vanilla pod and just leave it in for flavor.
- Blackberry Syrup:
- Add the blackberries to a blender with the water. Puree until completely smooth and blended, then strain over a fine mesh sieve into a bowl – so all you have is blackberry juice. 
- Combine the juice and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in a jar. This syrup can get extra sweet due to the flavor of your berries, so feel free to play along with water and sugar ratios.
- Cinnamon Brown Sugar Syrup:
- Combine the sugar, cinnamon and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
- Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling. 
- Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in a jar.
- Almond Syrup:
- Combine the sugar, water and extract in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
- Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling. 
- Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in a jar.
