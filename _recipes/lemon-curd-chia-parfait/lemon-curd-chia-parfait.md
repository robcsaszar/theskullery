ingredients:
- for the lemon curd:
- 2| lemons zest, freshly grated
- 0.75| cup(s) sugar
- 0.25| cup(s) unsalted butter softened
- 2| large eggs
- 0.25| cup(s) freshly squeezed lemon juice 
- for the chia parfaits:
- 1.5| cup(s) almond milk or your milk of choice
- 0.5| cup(s) chia seeds
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- for topping:
- sliced almonds
- hemp hearts
- frozen blueberries

directions:
- Lemon Curd:
- Place the lemon zest and sugar in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is combined.
- Beat the butter until creamy in your electric mixer and then beat in the sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time until combined. Beat in the lemon juice - if it looks a little curdled, that's okay! Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and heat over low heat. Cook until thickened, stirring the whole time, about 10 minutes. Remove and let the mixture cool completely, then refrigerate it.
- This will make extra lemon curd, so keep it chilled in the fridge and use it on EVERYTHING.
- Chia Parfaits:
- To make the chia pudding, whisk together the milk, chia seeds and vanilla extract in a bowl until combined. Refrigerate it for 30 minutes, then whisk again. Refrigerate for another hour (or even overnight).
- To make the parfaits, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of lemon curd on the bottle of a glass. Add about 1/3 cup of the chia pudding on top of the lemon curd. Add another dollop of lemon curd. Then go in with your toppings! Almonds, hemp hearts, frozen berries - whatever you'd like.
