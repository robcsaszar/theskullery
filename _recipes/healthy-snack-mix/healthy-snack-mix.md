servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 1| cup(s) banana chips
- 1| cup(s) unsweetened, flaked coconut
- 0.75| cup(s) whole almonds
- 0.5| cup(s) pecans
- 0.3333| cup(s) pepitas
- 3| tbsp maple syrup
- 1| to 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 0.5| tbsp liquid/coconut aminos or low-sodium soy sauce/tamari
- 0.5| tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 0.5| tsp chili powder
- 0.5| tsp smoked paprika
- 0.25| tsp cinnamon
- 0.25| tsp cumin
- 0.25| cup(s) hemp hearts
- 0.25| cup(s) chia seeds
- 2| tbsp nutritional yeast

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 160Â°C. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray it with nonstick spray.
- On the sheet, combine the banana chips, coconut, almonds and pecans.
- In a saucepan, warm the maple syrup, coconut oil, aminos/soy sauce, pepper, chili powder, paprika, cinnamon and cumin until the oil is melted. Pour the mixture over the mix on the baking sheet and toss well.
- Sprinkle on the hemp hearts and chia seeds and toss once more. After some testing, I find that sprinkling them on after adding the wet ingredients helps them to stick and not clump on the sheet.
- Finally, sprinkle the mixture with nutritional yeast. Toss lightly once more if needed.
- Bake for 15 minutes, then toss and bake for 15 minutes more, until the mix is golden. 
- Remove it from the oven and toss, then let it cool completely. 
- Break it apart and portion out into bags. If desired, you can add a dried fruit, like cherries or cranberries, in with the mix.
