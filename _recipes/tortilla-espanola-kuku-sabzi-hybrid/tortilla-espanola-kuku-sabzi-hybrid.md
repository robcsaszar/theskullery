time: under 60mins
servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 2| tbsps butter or olive oil
- for the egg mixture:
- 4| large eggs
- pinch of garlic salt
- pinch of Tajín, or other chili powder-lime flavor-salt mix
- pinch of black pepper
- pinch of nutmeg *optional*
- 2| tbsps half and half *optional*
- for the fillings:
- 0.5| bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- 0.5| bunch leek, finely chopped
- 0.5| bunch dill, finely chopped
- 1| tbsp dried fenugreek leaves, finely chopped
- 0.5| large red onion, thinly sliced
- 0.25| tsp paprika

directions:
- In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt mixtures, turmeric, pepper, nutmeg, and half and half, until even and glossy.
- Wash the potato slices and soak in warm water in a separate large bowl for 10 minutes.
- Fry the potato slices in half of the butter or olive oil in a deep 10-inch (25-cm) cast iron skillet on high heat, or a similarly sized nonstick omelette pan or skillet. Tilt and move the pan to coat potatoes and pan evenly.
- When the potatoes are soft, tender, and deep brown, add the chopped herbs and onions and stir thoroughly. SautÃ© until onions are lightly browned.
- Push the vegetables into a mound in the center, or ring abutting the walls, of the skillet, ensuring plenty of empty space.
- Add the remaining half of the butter or olive oil to the pan and stir contents thoroughly to coat evenly. Lower the heat.
- Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, tilting and moving to ensure a flat layer of eggs, with the vegetables well-incorporated. Heat until the eggs have set on the sides.
- Gently push the edges of the tortilla-kuku sabzi hybrid toward the center of the skillet with two spatulas, making sure not to break it, and forming a large puck-like shape with a light brown crust on the bottom. Turn the heat off.
- Place a plate on the pan and carefully flip the egg puck over onto the pan. (It's okay to let the puck break if the panhandle's too hot, though.)
- Return the egg dish to the pan, this time with the uncooked portions on the bottom and the crust on top. Turn the heat on high until the crust forms on the bottom, then turn it off.
- Gently scrape and lift the tortilla-kuku sabzi hybrid off the pan. Carefully lift the whole egg dish onto plate and serve.
