servings: 1 

ingredients:
- 4| green chiles, *Anaheims are the best*
- 2| jalapeño peppers
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tbsp unsalted butter
- 0.5| sweet onion, diced
- 2| garlic cloves, minced
- 0.2| tsp salt
- 0.2| tsp pepper
- 1.5| cup(s) half-and-half cream
- 1| tbsp cornstarch
- 16| oz sharp white cheddar cheese, freshly grated
- 8| ounces Monterey Jack or Gouda cheese, freshly grated
- for serving:
- fresh cilantro
- tortilla chips

directions:
- To roast the peppers, preheat the oven to 200°C. Rub the peppers with a bit of olive oil and place them on a baking sheet. Roast until the outside skins begin to blister and char, about 30 minutes. 
- Remove the peppers and place them in a resealable plastic bag for 20 minutes to steam. *to shorten this process, you can grill or roast the peppers over your gas stovetop until charred, then steam in the resealable bag*
- Once the peppers have “steamed” in the bag, remove the blistered skin. Slice off the tops and remove the seeds (unless you want tons of heat), then dice the peppers.
- Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. Stir in the peppers, onions and garlic. Season with the salt and pepper. Cook until the onion softens, about 5 to 6 minutes. 
- Slowly stream in 1 cup of the half and half, whisking the entire time. In a bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup half and half and cornstarch until no lumps remain to create a slurry. - Stir the slurry into the saucepan and cook for a minute until the milk thickens. Reduce the heat to low.
- Stir in the grated cheese, one small handful at a time, until melted. 
- Transfer the mixture to a crock, larger bowl or a small crockpot heating on low. Top with fresh cilantro if you’d like. Serve immediately with chips.
