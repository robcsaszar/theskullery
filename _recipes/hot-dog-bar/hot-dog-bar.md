notes:
- For cookouts, estimate about 1.5 hot dogs per person. For toppings, they will differ depending on what's popular in your family. I'd say as long as you have 1 cup of most toppings (for instance, you don't need an entire cup of bacon! But you do need a cup of cheese and tomatoes), you're good. Use your judgement!
- Don't be afraid to get crazy - baked beans and mac and cheese actually taste amazing on hot dogs. Make it a carb party.

directions:
- To make the hot dog bar an easy process, make a list of all the toppings you'd like to have out. You can chop, cut and grate all of them the night before, place them in separate bowls or jars, then cover and store them in the fridge until it's go-time.
- Grilled Corn Salad:
- Stir together about 1.5 cups corn kernels with 2 tbsp chopped cilantro, a pinch of salt and pepper, a 0.25 teaspoon chili powder, juice from 0.5 lime and 2 to 3 tbsp crumbled cotija *A good substitute for fresh cotija cheese is Feta. A good substitute for aged cotija cheese is Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino Romano* cheese. This can be made the night before, but is probably best 2 to 3 hours before.
- Jalapeño-Apple 'Slaw: 
- Toss together 2 cups shredded green cabbage with 1 grated apple, 1 thinly sliced jalapeño pepper, a pinch of salt and pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and juice from 0.5 lime. This can be made the night before as it can get even more flavor in the fridge.

- jalapeño-apple 'slaw + spicy brown mustard

- grilled pineapple + BBQ sauce + diced shallot
