servings: 1 

ingredients:
- for the topping:
- 4| tbsp unsalted butter
- 0.33| cup(s) brown sugar
- 0.5| tsp cinnamon
- 2| tbsp bourbon
- 6| peaches, sliced into 1/4-1/2 inch slices (peeled if desired)
- for the cake:
- 2| cup(s) all-purpose flour
- 1| tsp baking powder
- 0.5| tsp salt
- 0.25| tsp cinnamon
- 12| tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 0.75| cup(s) sugar
- 2| large eggs
- 2| tsp vanilla extract
- for the bourbon whipped cream:
- 2| cup(s) cold heavy cream
- 2| tbsp bourbon
- 2| tbsp powdered sugar

directions:
- Topping:
- Place a 9-inch cake pan on your stovetop and heat it over low heat. Add the butter and once melted, whisk in the sugar and the cinnamon until it starts to bubble. Whisk in the bourbon, then stir for 15 seconds and turn off the heat. Let it sit there while you make the cake.
- Cake:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
- Place the butter in the bowl of your electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until creamy. Beat in the sugar and gradually increase the speed to high, beating until fluffy and scraping down the sides if necessary, about 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in each egg until combined. Beat in the vanilla extract.
- With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients and stir until the batter just comes together.
- Take the peach slices and place them in the bottom of the pan, over of the sugar and bourbon mix. Crowd the pan and layer the peaches slightly if needed. Place dollops of the batter all over the peaches and gently spread evenly to cover. Bake the cake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and set. Remove from the oven and only let it cool for about 5 minute, just so the fruit settles and stops bubbly. After 5 minutes (no longer!), run a knife along the edges of the cake and place a cake plate over top, then gently flip the cake to remove it from the pan. Here, you can fix any fruit than has slid off or rearrange it if desired. Let the cake cool completely before serving it with the bourbon cream.
- Bourbon Whipped Cream:
- Place the cold cream and bourbon in the bowl of your electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until peaks form. Beat in the powdered sugar and serve.
